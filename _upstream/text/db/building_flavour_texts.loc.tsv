They were required, as part of their construction, to be attached to a natural water source, or any body of water with a natural spring as its source. Pure water is drawn through an aperture which allows it to fill the mikve's immersion pool. Purification was required after sexual acts, the treatment of skin conditions, or the passing of bodily fluids. The idea of purification through water remains prevalent as it was during antiquity; the Zoroastrian Sassanids, for instance, used their bathhouses for purification as well as general sanitation.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_roman_civic_market_2	Forums were the beating heart of the Roman urban economy; they were places of social gatherings, political debates and meetings, but primarily functioned as marketplaces. If you had  something to sell, or something to say, the forum was the place to do it. Tabernae were permanent shops in the marketplaces; single barrel-vaulted rooms facing outwards to the rest of the market that sold everything from cloth to hot street food. Tabernae were the forerunners of modern shop fronts; the most famous remaining example being Trajan's Market, which was the last, and greatest, of the magnificent Imperial forums. It was so sprawling that many have since referred to it as the world's first shopping centre.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_roman_water_sewers_4	For Romans relieving oneself was a communal activity. The seats in a public latrine could number as many as thirty built in a square formation. There was no segregation according to class either. If an aristocrat was caught short far from home and his body-slave had forgotten the chamber pot then he would sit alongside an equestrian or plebeian in the same latrine. In any one of the 114 latrines found in Rome people would read, chat away and 'network' with each other. The poet Martial ridicules one man for hanging around in public toilets waiting for a dinner invitation! Continuing this sense of camaraderie the Romans also shared a communal sponge to clean up afterwards. The latrines were towards the bottom end of the extraordinary water system created by the Romans. After a latrine, water and its effluent contents went into the sewers.	true

Indeed, one measure of civilisation might be the distance between one's nose and the final resting place of one's bowel movements! Sewers are therefore a mark of superiority and civilisation. In the Roman world, water passed into the settlement via aqueducts and then channelled through public fountains, baths and latrines before passing into the drains, which eventually connected to central sewers that led to a major river or sea. Although far from perfect, this sanitation system would keep disease at bay until a population became so sprawling the sewers could no longer cope with the volume of effluvia it produced.	true

This was brought into particular focus by the ascension of the Persian Sassanid Empire, who generally showed utter contempt for the Arabs and their way of life. Emperor Khosrow I described the Arabs as greedy and gluttonous, condemning them for their obvious pride in such humble lifestyles, their disrespect for the material world (good food and displays of wealth meant little to them) and, particularly, their welcoming attitude towards outsiders. In turn, the Arabs mocked the Persians through poetry, whilst making sure they trumpeted Arab integrity and generosity above all else as virtues to be held in the highest regard.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_barbarian_civic_market_free	The mythical origin of the Langobards is built upon the mantra "it is better to maintain liberty by arms than to stain it by the payment of tribute" - essentially, better to die free than live as a slave. The historian Paul the Deacon states that the Langobardi extended this right of freedom to those they captured along the way - freeing both prisoners of war and the slaves of others and incorporating them into their armies to increase their strength. This practise made the Langobards not only more progressive than their contemporaries, but also a composite people whose way of life was changed by this multicultural influence.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_cha_bld_gold_3	Gold has attracted and fascinated humans since it was first found as a deposit in mountain rivers. As a malleable metal it can be made into virtually anything decorative from jewellery to armour plating, yet its softness makes it useless for tools or weaponry. It is also relatively simple to extract gold from rock as it is pure and easily distinguishable. Initially Rome and Greece had only small deposits but through their conquests gained access to greater supplies. Slaves would toil over six hundred feet below ground in mines that were exploited until they collapsed. The Greeks prized gold so highly that they attempted to turn base metals into gold, an ‘art’ known as alchemy. By the early Middle Ages gold had replaced silver as the most desirable, and therefore most expensive, substance in the world.	true

As such, markets sprang up close to natural harbours, and where rivers forked or roads met - and naturally settlements followed. Although the marketplaces themselves became semi-permanent spaces, what was sold very much depended on what was available in quantity, what could be transported, or what caught the eye of a particular trader at a particular time. At this point in history, and somewhat unsurprisingly, supply and demand operated only in the most basic of forms.  Bearing in mind the time and distances involved, and knowledge of the outside world required, there was no guarantee that what a customer wanted would be available next time, or indeed that either party would be present or even still alive when the next market was held. 	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_slav_zadruga_4_long	In his work 'De Bellis', Procopius describes the Slavs as a leaderless people, referring to their "democracy", which was focused on social equality and co-operation between equals. Slavic life was centred around the extended family or clan unit, which the Slavs called the 'zadruga'. These groups shared their property, livestock and collective wealth, all of which was administered by the family patriarch. The zadruga worked together for the mutual benefit of every member, and the only possible changes to the system took place when someone died, or when a daughter married. As it was based on a patrilocal system, meaning that married couples were obliged to live with, or near to, the husband's parents, a married daughter would cease to be a part of her genetic zadruga and become part of her husband's.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_pleasure_2	Every man needs respite, be it at the bottom of a glass or in the arms of another. Sex sells, and this was no less true in antiquity than now. In the pagan cultures of the ancient world, many prostitutes - male and female - worked under official sanction at temples and, although condemned under the Jewish law of Halakha, the "oldest profession" is even mentioned in the Bible - and in a comparatively positive light. For instance, the Book of Genesis contains the story of Judah's widowed daughter-in-law, Tamar, who poses as a roadside prostitute to trick him into making her pregnant after he cruelly withholds consent for her marriage to his youngest son. Amongst other entries, there is also mention in the Book of Joshua of a prostitute who helped the Jews capture Jericho from the Canaanites in return for legitimacy via conversion and honourable marriage. Generally, however, prostitution was strictly forbidden by both the religious and the secular laws of many ancient states, with those found guilty frequently put to death for the crime.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_semitic_major_1	'Ibex' - similar to wild goats - were sacred animals to the people of southern Arabia. Their natural habitat is arid, mountainous terrain, where they live in herds and feed on grass and leaves - their shiny coats keeping them cool by reflecting the strong Arabian sun. Unusually, ibex herds are segregated into male and female groups that only come together during Spring to breed. Clearly an important part of ancient Arabian religious life (the Sabaean god Almaqah was even known as "Master of the Ibex"), their distinctive features - long curved horns and cloven hoofs - are depicted on many architectural and monumental works constructed in the region, as well as on bronze lamps, fountains and stone steles found during archaeological excavations. Despite this, we know little about the true significance of ibex within ancient Arabian culture, except their association with rain and fertility.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_semitic_major_2	Also known as the "God of the Morning Star", Athtar (also known as Attar or Ishtar) was worshipped throughout Arabia in late antiquity prior to the rise of Islam in the region. Often depicted with a spear-point and accompanied by an ibex, his sacred animal, Athtar was a god of war ("He Who is Bold in Battle") and the bringer of water and, in the more arid Arabian regions, the god of thunderstorms. In Canaanite legends, Athtar ascended to the throne of the late Ba'al Hadad to rule the world in his stead. Unfortunately, he soon proved himself unsuitable to rule - mainly as he was too small for Ba'al's throne - and was forced to return to the underworld. Temples to Athtar usually contained an open area with a fire in the centre, sharing the Zoroastrian concept of "holy fire". The kings of Saba even practised a rite knows as "Hunting the Game of Athtar and the Game of Kurum" (Kurum being a consort of Athtar) in order to make it rain.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_semitic_major_3	Almaqah was both moon and sun god in Sabaean culture. He is recognised widely as a protector, defending his people - the "Children of Almaqah" - and depicted with a cluster of lightning bolts and a scythe-like weapon. Although generally considered a god of the moon, Almaqah is also the male counterpart to the Mesopotamian sun god, Shamash, which makes him a sun deity as well. His sacred animal was the bull, although he was also known as the "Lord of the Ibex" - the wild mountain goats being another sacred animal in the Arabian polytheistic pantheon. It seems Almaqah's influence was not merely confined to Arabia - it was also felt much further afield; there is evidence for temples dedicated to him as far west as Yeha and Addi Akawehm in the northern Ethiopian province of Tigray. According to steles found elsewhere in Tigray, Yeha's Temple of Almaqah was the central place of worship for the entire region.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eastmig_community_1	Many wars of late antiquity, particularly those of Arabia, were fought by the Roman Empire and largely nomadic, migratory peoples. The Tanukhids, a confederation of Arabic tribes with a military zeal that made them attractive to the Romans as foederati, fought in large part to survive. Their lifestyles meant that the spoils of war were simply the continuation of their favoured lifestyles, as illustrated by their revolts against Rome. The impressive Tanukhid lancers struck hard and fast, stripping many Roman settlements clean in the process and defeating the Roman army time and time again. The peace they eventually negotiated enabled the Tanukhids to dictate their terms to the Emperor Valens, who dutifully agreed.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_all_resources_marble_1	Although it was greatly advanced by the Romans, many other cultures had long traditions of quarrying and mining. Over time, skilled freemen and artisan stonemasons appeared, who could extract and prepare the raw materials on-site. Gold and gem mining in Egypt, for example, began with the extraction of material from easily accessible alluvial deposits, while shaft mining in Nubia began as early as 1300BC. In the latter, ancient methods such as fire-setting were employed, using water to rapidly cool the heated stone and shatter the rock face. Quarrying stone, for great cities and monuments, was well advanced by the 3rd century BC.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_religion_grecoroman_major_4_serapis	Serapis is a hybrid of Greek gods such as Demeter and Dionysus and Egyptian deities like Osiris and Apis, his combined nature emphasising abundance and resurrection. Serapis was devised by Ptolemy I in an effort to legitimise Macedonian rule in Egypt. Ptolemy endeavoured to achieve this through the construction of huge temples to Serapis - known as Serapeum - and making the cult of Serapis a focus of Ptolemaic policy. The cult of Serapis survived the Ptolemaic dynasty and became even more popular during Egypt's rule by the Roman Empire, although not without opposition. The illustrious Serapeum of Alexandria was burned down by a mob in AD389, but survived until Theodosius and the Empire's adoption of Roman Christianity.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_all_resources_orchards_fruit_4	Agriculture for food was an integral part of the economies and lives of the ancient civilisations. Aside from the staples of wheat and barley, fruits orchards and vineyards were a common facet of agriculture in Roman society.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_all_resources_gold_1	Gold has attracted and fascinated humans since it was first found as a deposit in mountain rivers. As a malleable metal it can be made into virtually anything decorative from jewellery to armour plating, yet its softness makes it useless for tools or weaponry. It is also relatively simple to extract gold from rock as it is pure and easily distinguishable. Initially Rome and Greece had only small deposits but through their conquests gained access to greater supplies. Slaves would toil over six hundred feet below ground in mines that were exploited until they collapsed. The Greeks prized gold so highly that they attempted to turn base metals into gold, an ‘art’ known as alchemy.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_religion_manichaeist_major_1	Manichaeism was an important Gnostic religion founded in Persia during the 3rd century AD. Its chief tenets describe an eternal struggle between darkness and light, where the spiritual world was good and the material one evil. This outlook quickly gained popularity throughout the Near East. Its founder, Mani, born in southern Babylonia, was initially permitted to preach his new religion throughout the Sassanid Persian Empire unopposed, before being declared a Christian heretic and imprisoned by the Persian emperor, Bahram I. Mani’s time in prison became known as the ‘Passion of the Illuminator’, during which he continued to develop his theories, dying there before the emperor could execute him; the exact date is unclear but is estimated to be between AD276 and AD277.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_judaism_major_4	Throughout the history of monotheism, many people have claimed to be their god's "chosen one". So, too, does Judaism believe, mostly, that its adherents are God's chosen people. Beyond this basic explanation, rabbis teach that Jews were chosen for a specific purpose. This is because God states in Exodus that "they shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation", which implies that the Jews were chosen to proselytise the true word of God. This idea influences all facets of Judaism, including daily prayer. The siddur, the Jewish prayer book, offers thanks to God for choosing the Jewish people, as does the Kiddush, a sanctifying prayer used during periods of religious observance.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_judaism_major_3	The Talmud is the central body of Jewish rabbinic literature. It covers over six thousand standard pages of text, spanning 63 treatises in two languages, Tannaitic Hebrew and Aramaic, and recognises the divine authority and law of the Oral Torah. Before the Talmud, the Oral Torah and traditions were the basis of scholarly pursuit and study. Although there was some notation, no definitive notes existed to assist the student. This was because interpretation varied greatly between different groups, making a definitive reading somewhat difficult to achieve. This, coupled with persecution leading to a fear that places of worship would be lost, caused a number of rabbis to try and codify the teachings of the Torah so that they would not be lost to future generations.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_judaism_major_2	The Mishnah is the first major revision to the oral traditions of the Torah and forms one part of the Talmud. The word 'Mishnah' is taken from the verb 'shanah', which means 'to study and review'. It was written during the early part of the 1st millennium AD, when there was a great deal of uncertainty due to the persecution of Jews. It was a reaction to the fear that the oral traditions of the Torah would be lost, and as such the traditions were revised and codified by Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi in the years before his death in AD217, which also makes the Mishnah the first major rabbinic work to be written. The Mishnah contextualises the teachings and meanings of the Torah through examples, with each of the oral traditions demonstrated by a known rabbi by his actions, to show their meaning.	true

Transcribed by Moses himself, it is said to have been passed down from God to Moses during his forty nights on Mount Sinai, and then again to Moses whilst at the Tabernacle. The words themselves are supposed to have existed even before the world, and were used as blueprints for its creation. Having said that, many scholars of the pre-Christian period believe the books themselves were written 600-400BC. As background narrative to the teachings, the Torah also contains the first few books of the Bible, within which specific lessons are interspersed and embedded in order to illustrate their ritual significance.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_all_resources_iron_1	According to early documentation it was the Hittites who first used iron to forge weapons whilst fighting the Egyptians. Despite being more brittle and variable in quality than bronze, iron was cheaper and more abundant so rulers could arm large armies of peasants more economically. It was used to make spear and arrow heads, swords and armour. Its versatility and availability made it very popular throughout the ancient world. Moulds were rarely used in the ancient world to create iron weapons. Instead they employed a laborious method of smelting ore at temperatures higher than those needed for copper. The iron was then broken free from the waste slag and shaped during a lengthy process of firing and pounding.	true

Even if not commanded by their gods, nations invoked them for strength in battle; for instance, the Romans hailing of Mars as they went to war, in the hope of divine victory. The later Crusades into the Holy Land are perhaps the most famous religious wars, but the Arab peoples also fought for their faith. For instance, Queen Mavia's Tanukhid rebellion against Rome was hugely successful, and saw the Roman army defeated on several occasions. When peace was finally struck, she demanded that Moses, a man well respected for his piety and said to have performed miracles, be made the first Arab bishop. As the Tanukhids were largely a nomadic people, Moses travelled with his congregation, mediating negotiations with the Romans and converting many Arabs to Christianity.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_cha_bld_mill_1	Before the advent of industrial mechanisation and electric power, harnessing the natural strength of water was an extremely effective method of generating energy for industry and agriculture. Water wheels and mills were first used in ancient Rome and India, and by the end of the 10th century AD there were estimated to be several thousand mills harnessing the power of water across Europe. Watermills work by catching a head of water from a river or stream on paddles which turn the device, transforming kinetic energy into rotational energy at the gearhouse. This, in turn, works the pestle and mortar mechanisms used to grind and mash the grain. The basic principle of watermills has never changed, though the machinery itself differs depending on where they are built - for instance, 'tide mills' at coastal settlements employ the same method of energy generation, but use the rising and falling motion of the tides to power the wheel, with water also stored during low tide so that the mill could still be operated.	true

First constructed to catch rainwater during the monsoon to irrigate crops, the dam was modified in height and breadth over many centuries. However, this weakened the structure, leading to more frequent breaches that were more difficult to repair on each subsequent occasion. The dam has remained unrepaired since late in the 6th century AD; it is thought that the cost of repairs was too great following the collapse of the Himyarite Kingdom earlier in the century. This state of affairs led to the mass-migration of around 50,000 people who had been living in the Dhana Valley at the time, a great movement of people by the standards of the time, and something that even warranted a mention in the Quran.	true

The racing of horses for sport went hand in hand with their military use, and of course provided useful training for both rider and animal.	true

Instead, oxen were used as beasts of burden for transport and to work on farms, where their manure was also used to raise the crops. Cattle trading was big business; the size of a herd was an old measure of wealth from before coinage became standardised. Food production was one of the driving forces behind Roman expansionism. Wherever their armies went, they needed a continuous supply of animals for food to support them. It was because of this that Rome developed animal husbandry throughout its Empire in order to increase yields and feed its vast armies.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_all_resources_gems_alamanni	The beauty of precious and semi-precious stones, coupled with their relative rarity, is what gives them their value and desirability. The difficulty of obtaining them, and the resplendent image they presented, meant that gems quickly became signifiers of great wealth and, by extension, important people. In antiquity, the practise of what would come to be known as 'conspicuous consumption' was used throughout the world to denote key positions. Alamannic kings decorated themselves with jewellery and crowns encrusted with gemstones as ostentatious displays of their dominance. Tribal warriors and kings were often buried with their regalia, providing us with much knowledge of the skill of ancient craftsmen.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_cha_bld_monastery_2	Monasticism probably originated in the east, through Coptic Christian doctrine, before spreading to Europe. The monastic life was one of seclusion and strict adherence to Christianity’s fundamental tenets - study, prayer and manual labour away from the pressures of ordinary life. Everything else was considered unimportant and simplified accordingly. For instance, the monks’ mealtimes were rigidly timed and their diets very basic. Monasteries became the centre of the communities they served, as monks were well versed in all manner of skills with which to aid the local populace, and doing so was considered an important Christian duty. As a result, monks took it upon themselves to teach poor boys the Psalms, as well as basic grammar and arithmetic. Furthermore, their study of medicine and pharmaceuticals helped advance healthcare, an area in which the western powers had hitherto fallen far behind their Muslim rivals.	true

Field engineers became adept in the arts of using whatever resources were to hand to construct catapults, siege towers and battering rams to break down the enemy’s defences. The scorpion, a crossbow-like spear-thrower, the fire-raiser, a burning cauldron attached to a long beam on wheels, and the sambuca, a type of covered troop ladder, were early innovations in siege engineering. As far back as the 2nd century BC Philip V of Macedon was using catapults along with field works in his defence of the Aous Valley, where the Romans lost many men due to his siege engines.	true

The growing and fermenting of grapes began as early as 7000BC in what is now the Caucasus. However, much of modern wine culture derives from the practices of the ancient Greeks. To the ancient peoples wine was not so much a pastime as a religion: the goddess Geshtinana in Egypt, Bacchus in Rome and Dionysus in Greece all looked over the produce of the fermented grape. Wherever the Romans conquered they also traded, settled and drank, which accounts for the great spread of viticulture throughout the Empire years and the establishment of the major wine regions and grape varieties we know today. However the ancients would have thought us barbaric for drinking wine undiluted; a civilised culture always mixed at least one part wine to two parts water.	true

The word itself is a Greek term and, as might be expected of the civilised, settled Greeks, they did not approve of barbarous nomads in the slightest. Nomads, on the other hand, may not have had permanent settlements, but their lives were as full and rich as settled farmer or city dweller and probably healthier too, as they didn’t live in squalor. Nomadism is an extremely effective way of living off areas with scarce natural resources such as the steppes. As grazing is exhausted, the herds can be moved on and the land left to recover until the following year. It is also an extremely effective and ruthless way of raising warriors. The easiest way of harvesting scarce resources is, of course, to take them from someone else. The tribe who cannot protect their own livestock, property and kin soon ceases to exist. This also encourages the worst feature of nomad life for neighbouring, settled peoples: nomads will raid and steal from weak, sedentary folk because they are just another resource to be exploited. 	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_slav_wonder_military_2_long	The wolf is one of animism's most enduring spirit animals. From the Celtic wolf depictions of the Morrigan and the Cailleach, the wolf mothers of Roman and the Turkish legends, all the way to Native American myths and folk tales, wolves represent the connection between the physical, mortal world and the metaphysical plane of the gods and the cosmos in many pagan religions, where they are considered messengers between the divine and the corporeal. To the early Slavs, the wolf was connected to Horz, the god of the moon, and his dominion over night and the hours of darkness. The connection between wolves and the moon (and specifically, their howling) is now common folklore but to the Slavs, the night was when the wolves hunted. Although revered by tribal pagans, they were also feared; wolves are hunters and predators that presented both a challenge and a threat to the Slavic people, as they were difficult to hunt and extremely dangerous when encountered. Nevertheless, the Slavs respected anything that made them stronger, assuming they survived the experience of course!	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_roman_east_senate_5_legendary	Originally beginning as a council of noble advisors for Rome’s line of kings, the Senate gradually became the most powerful body in Roman politics – creating laws, raising funds for public works and passing judgement over all aspects of society. War and politics have always been intrinsically linked; the Senate’s elected Magistrates – the Consuls and Proconsuls – even led Rome’s citizen armies until the military reforms in the 1st century BC, such was the extent of their influence over every sphere of Roman life. Reaching the height of its power during the high Republican period, the Senate fell into decline under the Triumvirates, the Principate and the Empire. By the beginning of the 1st century AD, it was largely a hollow body, with little real power and greatly reduced prestige amongst ordinary Romans; Senators had been proved fallible, greedy and self-interested – amongst the people it was no longer a given that the noble classes knew best. The problem, from the point of view of the reactionary patrician class, began when the People were permitted involvement in the business of government. Reformers such as Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Marius, both ‘novus homo’ – ‘new men’ - of the plebeians, managed to pass legislation, or agitate the mob to the point that made change inevitable, and not always change to the advantage of the ‘old guard’. The end of the Republic did not improve their position either; the Senate became an even greater irrelevancy under successive Emperors, who were often powerful enough to bypass their wishes or simply not inform them of any potentially contentious issue. By the Western Empire’s end, late in the 5th century AD, it was little more than an occasional court, sometimes given permission to try capital cases by the Emperor. However, once the Empire had collapsed in the west its Germanic inheritors – men such as the Gothic general Odoacer – revived the Senate’s fortunes somewhat, although by that point many Senators were willing to act as mere puppets in order to keep their lands, and lives, intact. Never as vital a force in the Eastern Roman Empire, the Senate was no more than a symbolic body and one that disappeared altogether during the 7th century.	true

These pots were then smashed to release the salt cake, resulting in large quantities of pottery shards or 'briquetage'.

As a malleable metal it can be made into virtually anything decorative from jewellery to armour plating, yet its softness makes it useless for tools or weaponry. It is also relatively simple to extract gold from rock as it is pure and easily distinguishable. Initially Rome and Greece had only small deposits but through their conquests gained access to greater supplies. Slaves would toil over six hundred feet below ground in mines that were exploited until they collapsed. The Greeks prized gold so highly that they attempted to turn base metals into gold, an ‘art’ known as alchemy. By the early Middle Ages gold had replaced silver as the most desirable, and therefore most expensive, substance in the world.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_military_infantry_5_zoroastrian	Warfare and religion have shared a strong connection throughout history. Even if not commanded by their gods, nations invoked them for strength in battle; for instance, the Romans hailing of Mars as they went to war, in the hope of divine victory. The later Crusades into the Holy Land are perhaps the most famous religious wars, but the Arab peoples also fought for their faith. For instance, Queen Mavia's Tanukhid rebellion against Rome was hugely successful, and saw the Roman army defeated on several occasions. When peace was finally struck, she demanded that Moses, a man well respected for his piety and said to have performed miracles, be made the first Arab bishop. As the Tanukhids were largely a nomadic people, Moses travelled with his congregation, mediating negotiations with the Romans and converting many Arabs to Christianity.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_roman_west_senate_5_legendary	Originally beginning as a council of noble advisors for Rome’s line of kings, the Senate gradually became the most powerful body in Roman politics – creating laws, raising funds for public works and passing judgement over all aspects of society. War and politics have always been intrinsically linked; the Senate’s elected Magistrates – the Consuls and Proconsuls – even led Rome’s citizen armies until the military reforms in the 1st century BC, such was the extent of their influence over every sphere of Roman life. Reaching the height of its power during the high Republican period, the Senate fell into decline under the Triumvirates, the Principate and the Empire. By the beginning of the 1st century AD, it was largely a hollow body, with little real power and greatly reduced prestige amongst ordinary Romans; Senators had been proved fallible, greedy and self-interested – amongst the people it was no longer a given that the noble classes knew best. The problem, from the point of view of the reactionary patrician class, began when the People were permitted involvement in the business of government. Reformers such as Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Marius, both ‘novus homo’ – ‘new men’ - of the plebeians, managed to pass legislation, or agitate the mob to the point that made change inevitable, and not always change to the advantage of the ‘old guard’. The end of the Republic did not improve their position either; the Senate became an even greater irrelevancy under successive Emperors, who were often powerful enough to bypass their wishes or simply not inform them of any potentially contentious issue. By the Western Empire’s end, late in the 5th century AD, it was little more than an occasional court, sometimes given permission to try capital cases by the Emperor. However, once the Empire had collapsed in the west its Germanic inheritors – men such as the Gothic general Odoacer – revived the Senate’s fortunes somewhat, although by that point many Senators were willing to act as mere puppets in order to keep their lands, and lives, intact. Never as vital a force in the Eastern Roman Empire, the Senate was no more than a symbolic body and one that disappeared altogether during the 7th century.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eastern_sassanid_military_infantry_1	Very few easterners were professional soldiers and none, save for the noble-born cavalry, were formally trained or drilled. Instead, troops were levied by rich landowners as an obligation during times of war. For instance, levied infantry were typically untrained spearmen, with archers and slingers the more experienced and elite foot units. As might be expected due to the local terrain, cavalry was an important component in an eastern army, and several styles of horseback warfare emerged as a result. Horse archers were used to wear down infantry with fast, incessant attacks before and after thunder-strike cavalry charges from the fearsome heavy shock cavalry that was beginning to dominate the battlefield. Melee or spear infantry's main purpose was to pin the enemy down whilst the cavalry carried out complex its outflanking manoeuvres, which naturally affected the quality of troops employed for the role.	true

Although the marketplaces themselves became semi-permanent spaces, what was sold very much depended on what was available in quantity, what could be transported, or what caught the eye of a particular trader at a particular time. At this point in history, and somewhat unsurprisingly, supply and demand operated only in the most basic of forms.  Bearing in mind the time and distances involved, and knowledge of the outside world required, there was no guarantee that what a customer wanted would be available next time, or indeed that either party would be present or even still alive when the next market was held. 	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_nomad_herders_goats_4	Goats are an extremely versatile species found naturally throughout the steppes. Kept and slaughtered by the nomadic tribes for their meat, milk, hides and fur, horns, and even dung for fuel, they found a practical use for almost every part of the animal. Goat hide is hard and leathery, making it an ideal material for use as a receptacle for water or wine, plus as a material with which to make rudimentary parchment. Their horns can be drunk from, sharpened into arrowheads, and even fashioned into scale armour for the cavalry who formed the mainstay of steppe armies. Even their intestines can be cleaned, scraped, soaked, and then drawn out into bowstrings for the formidable steppe archers.	true

Equus ferus’ role was tied to its physical form – the small, early horse could only be used to pull primitive chariots. Larger, faster horses were later bred and used by skirmishers to chase down troops, but it was not until the development of more muscular breeds that shock troops such as the cataphracts came into being. Their long lances and heavy armour made these new-style heavy cavalry units deadly against infantry, fundamentally changing the nature of warfare forever. The racing of horses for sport went hand in hand with their military use, and of course provided useful training for both rider and animal.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_bel_bld_camp_food_1	Roman storehouses, or 'horrea' were - even by modern standards - vast warehouses containing a myriad of supplies from across the Empire. The first horrea were built in Republican Rome during the 2nd century BC and the name slowly became synonymous with all buildings used for storing materials. Most famously, the enormous 'Horrea Galbae' of Rome covered roughly a quarter of a million square feet on its ground floor alone. Horrea were named usually for what they stored, such as a horreum candelaria (wax) or chartaria (paper), as well as 'horreum subterranea' - better known as a cellar. Most military fortifications had horrea attached to them for the provisioning and supply of the army - well-preserved examples include Hadrian's Wall, at the forts in Corbridge and South Shields.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_barbarian_industry_1	Many Roman writers portrayed the Celts as a crude people who lived for war and little else. When describing them, Polybius commented that “their lives are very simple, and they have no knowledge whatsoever of art or science”. Thanks to archaeological finds we know this to be an oversimplification of a very complex society, and examples of Celtic art found all over Europe tell a very different story. Items like the Gundestrup Cauldron and the Desborough Mirror show that they had excellent metalworking skills, an artistic eye and the ability to tell stories through their art. The intricate detail on the cauldron was preserved by the peat bog in which it was discovered. The glass used in the figures' eyes gives some idea of the excellent art and craft skills of the men who made it.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_religion_grecoroman_major_4_cult	Before the advent of Christianity as the Empire's official religion, the Romans held a pantheon of gods. Although they were all understood to have once been human, no living man was worshipped as divine. As the Republic waned and began to assume the trappings of Empire, however, the cult of Imperial divinity began to rise. Claiming divine birthright, Caesar fostered the cult of the 'Divine Emperor', which only grew stronger during the illustrious reign of Augustus. Monuments and deistic images of the Emperors persisted as a manifestation of this extreme cult of personality, and they allowed it to remain as a propaganda device. The cult itself persisted as an official religion until Theodosius I made Christianity the state religion, at which point the cult and the 'old' gods of Rome were officially abandoned. 	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_barbarian_farm_agriculture_3	Enclosing land allowed farmers to keep a better watch on their herds and flocks. The construction of wooden fences and banks of earth also served to keep intruders and wild animals away from livestock. It is thought that some Celtic farmers valued their animals so highly they let them sleep inside their homes at night to make doubly sure that they would be safe from thieves and predators. More practically, this is also a good way of keeping everyone in a family warm. As Celtic society progressed and the population increased, large fortified settlements sprang up all over Europe. Many of these settlements had separate enclosures that were probably intended for livestock. During times of war the animals would have been driven between the inner and outer defences of a hill fort, protecting them from attackers while maintaining a fresh food source for the defenders.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_barbarian_farm_agriculture_2	Not only did the Celts develop a field system that made it possible to clearly define the boundaries between farms, they also made machines that were far more advanced than those used by the Romans or the Greeks. The Celtic plough had a coulter, a sharp blade that turned the soil over on itself. This allowed farmers to work land that had previously been inaccessible to arable farming. A wide variety of crops were grown by the Celtic people, depending on the local climate and soil. For example, the Picts of Scotland were unable to grow olives and grape vines like the Gaulish tribes of the Po Valley; they relied instead on the raising of sheep for food and wool.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_barbarian_farm_agriculture_4	Basic irrigation systems were widespread in the ancient world because they were simple to maintain. Perennial irrigation was rarer, and required longer canal systems, a method of storage, and better maintenance to ensure that silt and salt build-up was kept in check. River systems supplied water to the surrounding arable land through a system of canals, closed off by dykes and sluice gates. Water was stored in reservoirs, either natural or man-made, and then lifted into the irrigation channels. While this was a labour-intensive task, the results of such toil were remarkable and hugely beneficial to harvests.	true

They were also used to transport loads, particularly along the vast plains and trade routes of the eastern empires. There is evidence that the nomadic people to the north of the Sassanid Empire engaged in transhumanism - the seasonal movement of people and livestock to better pastures - indicating that the raising of cattle and animals remained an important part of their lives.	true

They might have been erected as monuments to commemorate a momentous achievement - such as victory in battle - or to issue decrees from the king or government. Though found right across the ancient world (the most famous probably being the Rosetta Stone that enabled the first translation of Egyptian hieroglyphs), there are many impressive examples of stone stelae in the Horn of Africa, as they were an important means of communication for the kings of Aksum. One, although unfinished, is taller than even the largest of the Egyptian obelisks. One of the largest concentrations of stelae is at Tiya, where over 100 stone slabs have been discovered alongside tombs - indicating they were used to mark graves as well as describe their occupants or patron gods.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_semitic_minor_faction_2	During antiquity, scholars attempted to divine knowledge of their fates by trying to interpret the movements of the stars and planets, as they were thought to hold the key not only to men's' destinies, but also to the behaviour of the natural world. The stars were used to explain and predict catastrophes, such as the death of 500 people during a rebellion at Bayt-Baws, which was attributed to the overshadowing of Venus by Mars. The twelve signs of the zodiac remain unchanged to this day, though the attributes of each have changed as subsequent cultures have influenced astrological thought. Most steles of the time show the zodiac in a rectangular format, with the date ascending from left to right - entirely unlike the circular layout we use today.	true

Originally an open market, it developed from a selling space to become the theatre for all important civic business: oration, gladiatorial contests, games, trials, executions and triumphal processions by returning armies. They were even used for elections. The original Forum in Rome was built on drained marshland in one of the oldest sections of the city. It grew into a hive of bustling trade with several huge buildings surrounding the public square. Government offices stood alongside cattle markets as the whole of Roman society rubbed shoulders as they traded, debated and socialised. Everywhere the Romans went they built new forums as essential meeting places and centres of commerce.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_judaism_major_faction_1	The Torah contains guidance and teachings on the correct observance and rituals of Judaism. The word itself literally means 'instruction', and is a way of life for those who follow it closely. The book gives instructions on how Jews should live their lives in a broad sense, as well as the more orthodox disciplines of the Kabbalah. Transcribed by Moses himself, it is said to have been passed down from God to Moses during his forty nights on Mount Sinai, and then again to Moses whilst at the Tabernacle. The words themselves are supposed to have existed even before the world, and were used as blueprints for its creation. Having said that, many scholars of the pre-Christian period believe the books themselves were written 600-400BC. As background narrative to the teachings, the Torah also contains the first few books of the Bible, within which specific lessons are interspersed and embedded in order to illustrate their ritual significance.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_judaism_major_faction_2	The Mishnah is the first major revision to the oral traditions of the Torah and forms one part of the Talmud. The word 'Mishnah' is taken from the verb 'shanah', which means 'to study and review'. It was written during the early part of the 1st millennium AD, when there was a great deal of uncertainty due to the persecution of Jews. It was a reaction to the fear that the oral traditions of the Torah would be lost, and as such the traditions were revised and codified by Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi in the years before his death in AD217, which also makes the Mishnah the first major rabbinic work to be written. The Mishnah contextualises the teachings and meanings of the Torah through examples, with each of the oral traditions demonstrated by a known rabbi by his actions, to show their meaning.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_judaism_major_faction_3	The Talmud is the central body of Jewish rabbinic literature. It covers over six thousand standard pages of text, spanning 63 treatises in two languages, Tannaitic Hebrew and Aramaic, and recognises the divine authority and law of the Oral Torah. Before the Talmud, the Oral Torah and traditions were the basis of scholarly pursuit and study. Although there was some notation, no definitive notes existed to assist the student. This was because interpretation varied greatly between different groups, making a definitive reading somewhat difficult to achieve. This, coupled with persecution leading to a fear that places of worship would be lost, caused a number of rabbis to try and codify the teachings of the Torah so that they would not be lost to future generations.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_judaism_major_faction_4	Throughout the history of monotheism, many people have claimed to be their god's "chosen one". So, too, does Judaism believe, mostly, that its adherents are God's chosen people. Beyond this basic explanation, rabbis teach that Jews were chosen for a specific purpose. This is because God states in Exodus that "they shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation", which implies that the Jews were chosen to proselytise the true word of God. This idea influences all facets of Judaism, including daily prayer. The siddur, the Jewish prayer book, offers thanks to God for choosing the Jewish people, as does the Kiddush, a sanctifying prayer used during periods of religious observance.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_cha_bld_spring	Springs were areas of both practical and religious significance in the ancient world. In times when rivers were prone to contamination and subject to seasonal variations, springs provided a consistent source of pure water for a population. The necessity of water earned it a place in the mythology of many ancient religions, and the sight of this precious substance gushing out of the ground was enough evidence for many sites to be declared sacred. Legends sprang up to explain their origins and miraculous powers were often assigned to them, invoked by votive offerings of precious objects.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eastern_sassanid_water_minor_3	Qanats are a series of shafts connected by sloping tunnels that channel water underground over great distances. Dug deep into hills and mountains to take advantage of the higher water table, water is directed out into distribution canals. Being underground, little water is lost due to evaporation and so qanats provide a clean water supply relatively safe from natural disaster and sabotage. Following their development during the early 1st millennium BC, qanats spread rapidly across Africa and Asia. An overly-steep one would let the water flow too fast, draining the source and eroding the tunnel; if it was too shallow the water would not flow at all. Successful development of a qanat network required skilled artisans to locate potential water sources, plan routes, dig passageways to the right gradient and then keep them clear. 	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eastern_sassanid_water_minor_2	Canals were a common feature of regions without major waterways or where the annual flow was insufficient to supply farms and communities with the water needed to sustain life. Whatever the source, water often needed to be carried great distances to reach the people, animals and farmland that depended on it. As a precious commodity in hot climates, water control was a matter of vital importance. Reservoirs were used to store water for particularly dry times. Eventually, sophisticated water channelling systems were developed and carefully graded to manage flow. Once the water had reached its destination, sluices directed the water to the surrounding farms.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eastern_sassanid_water_minor_1	Water was a precious resource in the east. The people needed it, agriculture needed it, and the tanning and textile industries needed it. Eastern cities made extensive use of wells and cisterns dug deep into the ground to draw and store water. Enclosed cisterns, covered to reduce the loss of water from evaporation, were essential for regulating water supply, creating reserves for use in dry spells that would otherwise devastate crops and livestock. These were assisted by the use of underground water systems, like qanats, and the networks created by the north African Garamantian people to 'mine' water.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eastern_sassanid_water_minor_4	Most commonly fed from subterranean aqueducts, springs or rivers, public fountains date to as early as the 6th century BC, providing accessible drinking water for the communities they served. Often carved from marble, fountains consisted of a great basin fed by bronze piping, usually with a stylised, mask-like waterspout. Animals, mythic beasts, and the gods were common designs. A fountain or pool was often the centrepiece of a courtyard or garden, and a display of power and wealth in eastern cities. Wells, springs and waterways channelled water to fill enclosed cisterns designed to reduce water loss through evaporation, which in turn fed the fountains by gravity.	true

Skills were perfected and guilds set up to teach and protect the profits against outside competition. Blacksmithing, pottery and weapon-making are all examples of trades handed down from father to son, generation to generation, in small workshops built alongside homes and other businesses. Some trades and skills, however, were less than pleasant for the workers and their neighbours: in a fuller’s workshop the art of dyeing required the use of urine, which was collected in receptacles in the streets. The fuller spent his day treading the urine into the cloth with his bare feet. The clothes were then rinsed and sulphur was applied to rid them of any lasting stains.

Alamannic society was divided into ‘pagi’, or autonomous 'cantons' along the banks of the Rhine. Often, pagi would pair-off into kingdoms, which created a network of lesser Alamannic kings. In times of war, these rulers would unify under a single king to direct their efforts, as in the case of Chrocus, in AD306, who raided Roman territory along the Germanic frontier.	true

Although generally considered a god of the moon, Almaqah is also the male counterpart to the Mesopotamian sun god, Shamash, which makes him a sun deity as well. His sacred animal was the bull, although he was also known as the "Lord of the Ibex" - the wild mountain goats being another sacred animal in the Arabian polytheistic pantheon. It seems Almaqah's influence was not merely confined to Arabia - it was also felt much further afield; there is evidence for temples dedicated to him as far west as Yeha and Addi Akawehm in the northern Ethiopian province of Tigray. According to steles found elsewhere in Tigray, Yeha's Temple of Almaqah was the central place of worship for the entire region.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_semitic_major_faction_2	Also known as the "God of the Morning Star", Athtar (also known as Attar or Ishtar) was worshipped throughout Arabia in late antiquity prior to the rise of Islam in the region. Often depicted with a spear-point and accompanied by an ibex, his sacred animal, Athtar was a god of war ("He Who is Bold in Battle") and the bringer of water and, in the more arid Arabian regions, the god of thunderstorms. In Canaanite legends, Athtar ascended to the throne of the late Ba'al Hadad to rule the world in his stead. Unfortunately, he soon proved himself unsuitable to rule - mainly as he was too small for Ba'al's throne - and was forced to return to the underworld. Temples to Athtar usually contained an open area with a fire in the centre, sharing the Zoroastrian concept of "holy fire". The kings of Saba even practised a rite knows as "Hunting the Game of Athtar and the Game of Kurum" (Kurum being a consort of Athtar) in order to make it rain.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_semitic_major_faction_1	'Ibex' - similar to wild goats - were sacred animals to the people of southern Arabia. Their natural habitat is arid, mountainous terrain, where they live in herds and feed on grass and leaves - their shiny coats keeping them cool by reflecting the strong Arabian sun. Unusually, ibex herds are segregated into male and female groups that only come together during Spring to breed. Clearly an important part of ancient Arabian religious life (the Sabaean god Almaqah was even known as "Master of the Ibex"), their distinctive features - long curved horns and cloven hoofs - are depicted on many architectural and monumental works constructed in the region, as well as on bronze lamps, fountains and stone steles found during archaeological excavations. Despite this, we know little about the true significance of ibex within ancient Arabian culture, except their association with rain and fertility.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eastmig_military_inf_3	The uprisings of the Palmyrene Queen Zenobia and, later, Mavia of the Tanukhids drummed up immense popular support and anti-Roman feeling in the Levant and Near East. Mavia's campaign of liberation led her from Arabia through Palestine, and then down towards Egypt. Buoyed-up by Roman defeats, every town and city along the way was incensed to join her cause, and so the rebellion grew in strength. Furthermore, many Imperial troops who had grown up and operated in Arabic territory were also galvanised. As such, there were many cases of Roman soldiers defecting when they realised that the Arabic cause of freedom was more important than the fate of the swollen, corrupt Empire.	true

Entertainment here was on a massive scale. Situated in a natural valley, the Circus has became synonymous with chariot racing but was used for all kinds of elaborate 'ludi', or games, often to celebrate religious festivals. Rather like the modern Olympics, the games were paid for by rich sponsors and tried to outdo previous events in terms of grandeur and pageantry. As well as chariot races, boxing, wrestling, gladiator contests, athletics, plays, recitals and even elephant fighting featured as events. The Circus Maximus itself was rebuilt several times, to make it grander, safer for spectators, and then more dangerous and exciting again: Julius Caesar ordered a moat to protect the crowd, but Nero then had it filled in so that everyone could be closer to the action!	true

Used for the richer members of the audience to show off to lesser folk, and to celebrate religious festivals, their main purpose was as an arena for gladiatorial games. Blood became the staple entertainment of the Roman people. Every corner of the Empire from Britain to Syria had its amphitheatres. They ranged in size from small wooden structures to the great Colosseum in Rome. Here the plebeians could be entertained, and watch gladiators demonstrating the Roman virtues of courage and fortitude, and enjoy the bloodlust, spectacle and cruelty. They were also important to the social order: events were often free, paid for by patrician aristocrats, the wealthy, and emperors, all hoping for public support.	true

The people needed it, agriculture needed it, and the tanning and textile industries needed it. Eastern cities made extensive use of wells and cisterns dug deep into the ground to draw and store water. Enclosed cisterns, covered to reduce the loss of water from evaporation, were essential for regulating water supply, creating reserves for use in dry spells that would otherwise devastate crops and livestock. These were assisted by the use of underground water systems, like qanats, and the networks created by the north African Garamantian people to 'mine' water.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_barbarian_civic_chieftain_5_legendary	As barbarian society developed the need for larger settlements was greater, in order to house their ever-larger populations. This gave rise to an increase in the number of fortified settlements built on areas with natural defences such as hilltops, cliffs or river banks. Stone or wooden defences were then added, setting them apart from smaller settlements. Some historians argue that the addition of fortifications was not a defensive decision but was, in fact, a matter of tribal prestige. As such, a tribe could have more than one fortified settlement and their sizes varied significantly. Julius Caesar, in his study of the Gauls, named their versions 'oppidum', noting that the differing sizes appeared to indicate the power structure within each tribe.	true

Following this (for the time) extremely controversial statement, he was branded a heretic by the First Council of Nicaea in AD325, called by Emperor Constantine in an attempt to unify the church’s teachings throughout Christendom. Despite the Council’s findings, there were many who followed Arius’ teachings and they spread quickly from the academic centre of Alexandria. For instance, many of the northern barbarian tribes found Arianism a far more believable concept than traditional Catholicism.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eastern_sassanid_civic_court_2	In the ancient world, religion held much larger sway over every aspect of society, including lawmaking and judgement in civil and criminal cases. For instance, Sassanid laws were intrinsically linked to their religion, Zoroastrianism. The Prophet of the religion, Zoroaster (or Zarathustra) is portrayed very much as an arbiter of justice, presiding over many legal and civil affairs. Indeed, he viewed humanity's greatest struggle as that between truth and deceit, and that truth should be the highest goal man should aim for, emphasising the individual's personal responsibility for choosing right or wrong. Indeed, in many other eastern societies it was the priests who were vested with both administrative and judiciary responsibility; high ranking religious officials were often called to sit in judgement or offer advice to the monarch – after all, their approval for a course of action was the next best thing to the assent of God himself.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_all_industry_major_pottery_2	The firing of clay to form earthenware began as far back as 10,000BC, when it mainly consisted of water-carrying vessels. Pots were made by burying them in pits under large open fires. The pottery wheel was invented around 3000BC, enabling the craft to develop greatly from that point on. Clay was cheap, readily available and could be quickly made into plates, jars and crockery of all kinds. Eventually, the Greeks took pottery more seriously and started to decorate containers with art from their mythology. The next big leap was the introduction of glazing to line clay pots and make them less porous. This technique, first developed in the 1st century BC, hugely improved the standard of finish and a container’s ability to hold liquids. 	true

Due to the simplicity of its ingredients, adobe makers could easily construct temporary works next to large building sites. In large cities, where space was at a premium, areas would always be given over to adobe production.	true

Therefore, in the name of variety, eastern cavalry took many forms. As a result short swordsmen, light skirmishers and archers were all used, but the primary, most effective weapon was the lance, particularly amongst the heavy cavalry elite. The kontos was a wooden lance, roughly four metres in length, and was much stronger than contemporary Roman and Hellenistic lances. According to Plutarch, the strength of the lance and the power the rider put behind it meant that, purportedly, it could even skewer two men at once.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eastern_sassanid_civic_market_spice_3	Agriculture was the lifeblood of those outside the cities. Within the urban centres, however, the economy was driven by the market and the merchant. The marketplace was a bustling hub of craftsmen plying and selling their trades; from blacksmiths to clothmakers, all earning a living and feeding the city's wealth. The markets also sold imported goods from colourful lands in the Far East, and this business was done by the merchant. Interestingly, the merchant was looked down upon by most of Sassanid Zoroastrian society, as he did not fit neatly into one of the three ideals of their religion's societal structure. The duty of procuring far off trade, then, often fell to Sogdians, Christians and ex-prisoners of war, settled in Persia and with everything to gain.	true

Trade along what would become the Silk and Spice Roads began almost at the start of civilisation with the rise of farming and trade amongst Neolithic communities. It was not until Arab and Phoenician traders began trading spices and other luxury goods, such as gold, precious stones, silks and fine textiles, that fixed routes and markets began to appear. As well as spices to flavour foods, other items were traded, including those considered essential for religious rites, such as frankincense - tree resin which gives off a strong aroma when burned. Myrrh was also highly valued for its uses as a medicine and for mummification.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_barbarian_farm_curing	The 1st century AD was marked by severe climate change, resulting in a dramatic drop in temperatures across the known world. Harvests failed, soil fertility faltered, and people suffered and died. The cause of the shift has since been linked to probable volcanic activity, yet those dealing with the increasingly freezing climate knew simply that they must adapt or die. Climate change is one of the factors that started the Migration Period, but the tribes also acclimatised as best they could. The practise of curing allowed food to be preserved and sustained for longer periods of time, through the use of salt. Even before migration, the tribes of Gaul exported salted pork and even sausages to Roman Italy, where they became valuable supplies for armies on the march.	true

It grew into a hive of bustling trade with several huge buildings surrounding the public square.

However, Gaius Cornelius Tacitus, in the book ‘Germania’, writes about the Germanic tribes with great respect. He describes a people who were very open and hospitable, and who loved nothing more than feasting and celebrating great deeds. He was also impressed that they resolved all tribal issues at a council where every man's voice could be heard. Also remarking on the fidelity shown within Germanic marriages, there was one aspect of their lives that Tacitus found deplorable and barbaric - he thoroughly disapproved of “their habitual drunkenness”.	true

After his second invasion of Italy ended in defeat, Alaric went south to invade Africa. However, Alaric died before this could happen, of a fever at the city of Cosenza in AD410. Legend has it that his people diverted the course of the Busento River to bury their king, with all his kingly trappings and spoils of war, under the river bed. Once he was safely interred the river was redirected back to its usual course, thereby covering the gravesite.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_all_resources_gold_jeweler_4	Jewellers provided the ancient world with one of the most potent methods of displaying wealth and status. The art of smithing precious metals was re-introduced to the western Mediterranean from the east, which also acted as the source for most of the raw ingredients. The inevitable associations with far off places made jewellery all the more prestigious, as ownership signalled extensive trade connections. In time, the Greco-Roman world developed its own unique styles with ever increasing sophistication. The cameo, a method of carving a layered gem with a raised relief of contrasting colour, is arguably the finest example, and was highly sought after at the time.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_roman_east_civic_treasury_3	The minting of coins, in one form or another, can be traced back to Lydia in the 7th century BC. From there, it soon found its way to Greece and, in the following centuries, to Rome. The first Roman mint, and indeed the first reference to minting as a process, was in 269BC at the temple of Juno Moneta - which is also the root of the word 'money'. As well as a method of currency production, minting coins was a way of spreading news and enforcing propaganda - outlying territories could be informed of a new Emperor by a change in the face on the coins that paid their wages. Over time, the Emperor's legitimacy and power became linked to the production of personal, authenticating currency. When Diocletian became Emperor in AD284 he was determined to bring some stability back to an Empire in turmoil. In order to achieve this he introduced a series of reforms, including revisions to the coinage system in AD293. He started by closing down a large number of mints across the Empire, allowing legal tender to be produced only in designated places. This resulted in a total of fifteen mints, with each clearly marking its coins to show their origin. Although in the Eastern Empire Diocletian's reforms remained in place until at least the 5th century AD, this did not happen in the West due to the almost constant barbarian incursions suffered there.	true

This strong foundation helped the Eastern Empire to thrive and before long a multitude of customs houses sprung up to collect the duty on all the imported and exported goods that passed through the city. We know of the volume and location of these buildings due to the discovery of the customs seals used, along with other historical findings. This carefully controlled trade network enabled the Romans to reduce smuggling and better control their trade economy.	true

Under the rule of Constantine I a series of new offices were created, including Minister of Finance, the ‘Comes Sacrarum Largitionum’ or ‘Count of the Sacred Largesses’. This position gave its holder responsibility over the treasury and the vast bureaucracy that maintained it. His tasks included the collection of taxes from Senators, the chrysargyron trade tax, control of the budgets of each department of state, the inspection of mines, banks and mints all over the Empire, and the collection of customs duties.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_all_industry_major_generic_1	The firing of clay to form earthenware began as far back as 10,000BC, when it mainly consisted of water-carrying vessels. Pots were made by burying them in pits under large open fires. The pottery wheel was invented around 3000BC, enabling the craft to develop greatly from that point on. Clay was cheap, readily available and could be quickly made into plates, jars and crockery of all kinds. Mosaic as an art form was adopted by a wide range of cultures and dates back to the 3rd millennium BC. Many fine examples have survived, including those discovered in the ruins of the city of Bishapur in Iran. Founded by Shapur I in 266BC, it featured richly-decorated courtyards and reception rooms paved with beautiful mosaics.	true

Indeed, one measure of civilisation might be the distance between one's nose and the final resting place of one's bowel movements! Sewers are therefore a mark of superiority and civilisation. In the Roman world, water passed into the settlement via aqueducts and then channelled through public fountains, baths and latrines before passing into the drains, which eventually connected to central sewers that led to a major river or sea. Although far from perfect, this sanitation system would keep disease at bay until a population became so sprawling the sewers could no longer cope with the volume of effluvia it produced.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_all_livestock_generic_1	Herding is one of the original forms of basic agriculture that was disseminated around the Mediterranean in the Neolithic age. Populations that practiced herding obtained everything from food to furniture from the animals they owned, so were not tied to the land and could move freely in search of new grazing. This enabled a population to sustain itself in arid conditions unsuitable to cultivation, as well as making it resilient to climatic changes that might be devastating to a settled culture. The same mobility made herding populations famously difficult to control, especially as the habitual raids on the livestock of others led to the development of fearsome combat skills.	true

The changes meant that the Emperor himself became further and further removed from its day to day running; it was instead managed by layers of councillors. Closest to the Emperor was the 'Magister Officiorum' and the 'Quaestor', 'Master of Offices' and head jurist respectively. Below them were the deputies, the Vicarii and the Comites; the former being a civil office whereas the latter dealt with military affairs. This ever expanding bureaucracy ensured that the Emperor was not held personally accountable for the woes of the Empire, but was vulnerable to the machinations of ambitious councillors.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_slav_religion_major_4_long	During the 1st century AD, the eastern Slavs worshipped a pantheon of five gods known as the 'Quintheism'. These gods held dominion over different aspects of the world (the sun, the sky, the earth etc.). At the head of this pantheon was Perun, a thunder god who wielded an enormous axe (or sometimes a hammer) that returned to his hand when summoned. It is clear that Perun shares similarities with the thunder god Zeus, head of the classical Greek pantheon, as well as Thor and his hammer Mjolnir. Perun was above all other gods - the Slavs declared him the "creator of lightning" and "the only lord of all". In order to invoke his divine protection, his worshippers carved hexagonal symbols known as 'gromoviti znaci' onto the beams and foundations of their homes in the hope that Perun would protect them from lightning storms. Like several gods from other cultures, Perun seems to be derived from 'Perkwunos', a widely worshipped Indo-European thunder god. From Perkwunos comes the Thracian god 'Perkon' and the Hittite god 'Pirwa', as well as the Greek work for 'thunderbolt', 'karaunos'.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_religion_orthodox_major_church_5_legendary	The word Orthodox comes from the Greek words ‘orthos’ meaning ‘right’ and ‘doxa’ meaning belief, combining to mean ‘correct belief’ or ‘right thinking’. Orthodox Christians believe that they are following Jesus’ original teachings as presented by his Apostles. Also known as ‘Byzantine Christianity’ the Orthodox Church developed, and was shaped by, the Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire. When Theodosius became Emperor in AD 380 he was determined to return the east to Orthodox Christianity, a vision that was realised a year later. He convened the Second Ecumenical Council to further clarify matters that were discussed at the First, resulting in the condemnation of Arianism as heresy and the Orthodox Church becoming the Empire’s official faith.	true

The Cathedral of Zion became a place of spiritual and political significance in the region, as the reigns of Ethiopian Emperors not crowned there were not considered legitimate. Over the years, the church has been rebuilt several times (famously by the last Ethiopian emperor, Haile Selassie), and is alleged to be the final resting place of the Ark of the Covenant, a religious relic said to contain the stone tablets upon which the Ten Commandments are inscribed. Nobody has ever seen the Ark in its resting place in the chapel save for one monk who must watch it at all times and forbids anyone else from seeing it.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_slav_religion_major_2_long	During the 1st century AD, the eastern Slavs worshipped a pantheon of five gods known as the 'Quintheism'. These gods held dominion over different aspects of the world (the sun, the sky, the earth etc.). At the head of this pantheon was Perun, a thunder god who wielded an enormous axe (or sometimes a hammer) that returned to his hand when summoned. It is clear that Perun shares similarities with the thunder god Zeus, head of the classical Greek pantheon, as well as Thor and his hammer Mjolnir. Perun was above all other gods - the Slavs declared him the "creator of lightning" and "the only lord of all". In order to invoke his divine protection, his worshippers carved hexagonal symbols known as 'gromoviti znaci' onto the beams and foundations of their homes in the hope that Perun would protect them from lightning storms. Like several gods from other cultures, Perun seems to be derived from 'Perkwunos', a widely worshipped Indo-European thunder god. From Perkwunos comes the Thracian god 'Perkon' and the Hittite god 'Pirwa', as well as the Greek work for 'thunderbolt', 'karaunos'.	true

Following this (for the time) extremely controversial statement, he was branded a heretic by the First Council of Nicaea in AD325, called by Emperor Constantine in an attempt to unify the church’s teachings throughout Christendom. Despite the Council’s findings, there were many who followed Arius’ teachings and they spread quickly from the academic centre of Alexandria. For instance, many of the northern barbarian tribes found Arianism a far more believable concept than traditional Catholicism. Arianism spread to such a degree that Constantine later questioned the Council’s decision, leading to Arius’ exoneration in AD335 at the First Synod of Tyre.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eastern_sassanid_civic_court_entertain_3	Although its exact origins are now lost, Polo was one of the dominant sports of antiquity in the east. Popular in Arabic, Byzantine, Persian and Chinese cultures, it was seen as a means to practice and demonstrate horsemanship and many battle skills amongst those wealthy enough to own horses. A game only needed a flat field, but over time permanent pitches gradually appeared on which teams could train and play. Little is known about Polo’s early rules, scoring points by taking the ball from one end of the field to the other may have been the only one. This fits with the game's association with battle; riders may well have been allowed to strike or unhorse their opponents without penalty.	true

It is from here that we learn about Mokosh - the Slavic goddess of the harvest, fortune, fertility, and the protector of women. Mokosh was one of the five most important deities of the Slavic pantheon, known as the 'Quintheism', ruled over by Perun, lord of thunder. Each of these was tied to a particular plane of existence - the sun, sky, land, etc. Mokosh was connected with the earth, but also closely linked to destiny. The Slavs thought she weaved fate personally, and as such is often depicted sat at a loom, pulling destiny's threads together.	true

While initial versions were erected in wood for the purpose of just one performance, their increasing popularity led to official recognition in the form of monumentalised free standing structures. Surviving Roman plays are nearly all reworks of Greek tragedy and comedy with an increased focus on music and dance to appeal to the more spectacle orientated Roman audience. The social status of the theatre is hard to discern as, although writers and orators often condemned it as an immoral corrupter of the rabble, evidence suggests that performances were regularly attended and enjoyed by scholars and emperors alike.	true

Mavia's campaign of liberation led her from Arabia through Palestine, and then down towards Egypt. Buoyed-up by Roman defeats, every town and city along the way was incensed to join her cause, and so the rebellion grew in strength. Furthermore, many Imperial troops who had grown up and operated in Arabic territory were also galvanised. As such, there were many cases of Roman soldiers defecting when they realised that the Arabic cause of freedom was more important than the fate of the swollen, corrupt Empire.	true

He chose, due to an increasing number of followers and distractions, to live upon the top of a pillar in the ruins of Telanissa, with food and water being delivered to him by locals. Symeon eventually remained there for 37 years. Though it began at only a humble nine feet tall, the original pillar was replaced several times over the years, with the final one allegedly over fifty feet in height and protected by a high wall. Ironically, this determination to escape distractions resulted in even more visitors, and more frequently, as they wished to see the man on the column and ask him questions. It is said that Symeon was so famous and revered that even the Roman Emperor Theodosius II respected his words. The remains of his church - the "Qelaat Semaan" ("Fortress of Simeon") - and the base of his column still exist today, around twenty miles northwest of the city of Aleppo, in Syria.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_east_church_minor_faction_3	The clifftop monasteries of southern Arabia were built upon the top of 'amba', or flat-topped mountains. The most famous of these is the site at Debre Damo, built in northern Ethiopia during the 6th century AD. The monastery complex sits atop the mountain, over 2000 metres above sea level, with an entrance embedded high in the cliff side. It is only accessible by rope, with visitors having to be winched up the side of the sheer cliff face. Another of the monastery's peculiarities is that it can only be visited by men - women are entirely and strictly forbidden. A relatively large building, the monastery is home to many religious manuscripts probably created there by the tenant monks in their isolation. The site, through some extensive maintenance work, still stands today.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_religion_east_church_minor_faction_1	The practices of Arab Christians were quite distinct from those of their Romanised counterparts, emphasising community and an eremitic lifestyle over the more ostentatious, ceremonial religious observance of the Catholic or Orthodox Churches in the west. Monastic communities such as Kellia occupied large parts of the Nitrian Desert, their monks living remote, frugal lives stripped of the encumbrances of the civilised world. Another group, in the Scetes Desert of Egypt, were known as the "Desert Fathers", their hermit lifestyle being documented in the Apophthegmata Patrum - literally the "Sayings of the Desert Fathers".  These manuscripts act as a guide for desert hermits, focusing on spiritual practice and conveyed via a dialogue between a younger monk and his spiritual father, which may have been intended as a metaphor for the relationship between man and God.	true

Tools of bronze and later iron enabled land to be cultivated, ships to be built, stone to be quarried, and wars to be fought with greater and more terrible savagery than ever before. Blacksmiths were ubiquitous: every village and town of note had a smithy turning out anything the community needed. Smithing also encouraged trade, as the tin needed for bronze was not always a local resource. This is what led the Phoenicians to sail all the way to distant Britain: they were looking for a reliable, and plentiful, source of tin. It was the move from bronze to iron that gave warriors an edge in combat, often quite literally. In the hands of a strong man, an iron sword could cleave through bronze armour and weaponry with suitably unfortunate results for its target.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_slav_wonder_1_long	The wolf is one of animism's most enduring spirit animals. From the Celtic wolf depictions of the Morrigan and the Cailleach, the wolf mothers of Roman and the Turkish legends, all the way to Native American myths and folk tales, wolves represent the connection between the physical, mortal world and the metaphysical plane of the gods and the cosmos in many pagan religions, where they are considered messengers between the divine and the corporeal. To the early Slavs, the wolf was connected to Horz, the god of the moon, and his dominion over night and the hours of darkness. The connection between wolves and the moon (and specifically, their howling) is now common folklore but to the Slavs, the night was when the wolves hunted. Although revered by tribal pagans, they were also feared; wolves are hunters and predators that presented both a challenge and a threat to the Slavic people, as they were difficult to hunt and extremely dangerous when encountered. Nevertheless, the Slavs respected anything that made them stronger, assuming they survived the experience of course!	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_all_resources_lead	Found in abundance across the whole world, lead has been used by people for thousands of years as it is extremely soft, malleable and easy to extract by smelting. The Egyptians used it to glaze pottery and the Babylonians and Assyrians used lead sheets for construction. However, the Romans were the greatest exploiters of it, with an estimated annual output of eighty thousand tonnes. Lead was extracted from crushed and smelted galena ore, a by-product of silver mining. The Romans used 'plumbum' to line their baths and make their water pipes, hence the English word 'plumber'. Even the gladiators in the Coliseum used lead as knuckle covers.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_slav_bld_city_minor_1	As barbarian society developed the need for larger settlements was greater, in order to house their ever-larger populations. This gave rise to an increase in the number of fortified settlements built on areas with natural defences such as hilltops, cliffs or river banks. Stone or wooden defences were then added, setting them apart from smaller settlements. Some historians argue that the addition of fortifications was not a defensive decision but was, in fact, a matter of tribal prestige. As such, a tribe could have more than one fortified settlement and their sizes varied significantly. During late antiquity, some Slavic tribes were gifted forts by the Roman Empire in exchange for manning and defending the strategic point they guarded. Such was the case with the Anteans, who became Roman foederati in return for gold and promising to defend the Danube from the onslaught of the marauding steppe nomads.	true

Early Christians suffered years of persecution at the hands of the pantheistic Romans, especially during the reigns of the emperors Domitian, Trajan and Marcus Aurelius.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_all_resources_orchards_vineyard_4	Wine has been a big part of western civilisations for thousands of years. The growing and fermenting of grapes began as early as 7000BC in what is now the Caucasus. However, much of modern wine culture derives from the practices of the ancient Greeks. To the ancient peoples wine was not so much a pastime as a religion: the goddess Geshtinana in Egypt, Bacchus in Rome and Dionysus in Greece all looked over the produce of the fermented grape. Wherever the Romans conquered they also traded, settled and drank, which accounts for the great spread of viticulture throughout the Empire years and the establishment of the major wine regions and grape varieties we know today. However the ancients would have thought us barbaric for drinking wine undiluted; a civilised culture always mixed at least one part wine to two parts water.	true

If you had  something to sell, or something to say, the forum was the place to do it. Tabernae were permanent shops in the marketplaces; single barrel-vaulted rooms facing outwards to the rest of the market that sold everything from cloth to hot street food. Tabernae were the forerunners of modern shop fronts; the most famous remaining example being Trajan's Market, which was the last, and greatest, of the magnificent Imperial forums. It was so sprawling that many have since referred to it as the world's first shopping centre.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_bel_bld_all_industry_major_coin_4	The minting of coins, in one form or another, can be traced back to Lydia in the 7th century BC. From there, it soon found its way to Greece and, in the following centuries, to Rome. The first Roman mint, and indeed the first reference to minting as a process, was in 269BC at the temple of Juno Moneta - which is also the root of the word 'money'. As well as a method of currency production, minting coins was a way of spreading news and enforcing propaganda - outlying territories could be informed of a new Emperor by a change in the face on the coins that paid their wages. Over time, a ruler's legitimacy and power became linked to the production of personal, authenticating currency. When Theoderic deposed Odoacer and founded the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy, he at first minted coins bearing the head of the Roman Emperor. This was done as a propaganda move to placate him, and soften the blow that the Ostrogoths' restoration of the Western Empire was in fact really the conquest of former Roman territory; the coins went a long way to ensuring harmony between the two rulers.	true

The Romans perfected a technology that cannot be improved upon even today. In Rome itself over 400 kilometres of aqueducts were built to supply water to public bath houses, fountains, drinking basins and latrines. The water was also used for agriculture, mining and other industries. The majority of aqueducts were buried in the ground but the iconic image remains a towering bridge-like structure stretching across the landscape. The largest was the Aqua Marcia, which was some 144 kilometres long and delivered 182 million litres every day.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_roman_water_aqueducts_2	Water storage was a basic but essential part of life in Roman cities. Growing populations needed a constant supply of water. A reserve could be held, in case of fire or drought, in tanks placed along the aqueducts. Fire was a common threat in the ancient world. As many buildings were poorly made, watches were organised to prevent them. The Vigiles Urbani of Rome were a force consisting of armed citizens, equipped both to fight fires and patrol urban areas. They were not always successful: the great fire of AD64 burned for six days and destroyed a large part of Rome. As well as firewatching, the Vigiles were also used at night to keep civil order and stop sabotage or criminal activity. 	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_bel_bld_all_industry_major_gold_4	Gold has attracted and fascinated humans since it was first found as a deposit in mountain rivers. As a malleable metal it can be made into virtually anything decorative from jewellery to armour plating, yet its softness makes it useless for tools or weaponry. It is also relatively simple to extract gold from rock as it is pure and easily distinguishable. Initially Rome and Greece had only small deposits but through their conquests gained access to greater supplies. Slaves would toil over six hundred feet below ground in mines that were exploited until they collapsed. The Greeks prized gold so highly that they attempted to turn base metals into gold, an ‘art’ known as alchemy.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_bel_bld_all_industry_major_gold_2	Jewellers provided the ancient world with one of the most potent methods of displaying wealth and status. The art of smithing precious metals was re-introduced to the western Mediterranean from the east, which also acted as the source for most of the raw ingredients. The inevitable associations with far off places made jewellery all the more prestigious, as ownership signalled extensive trade connections. In time, the Greco-Roman world developed its own unique styles with ever increasing sophistication. The cameo, a method of carving a layered gem with a raised relief of contrasting colour, is arguably the finest example, and was highly sought after at the time.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_bel_bld_all_industry_major_gold_3	Porcelain enamel is created by using extreme heat to fuse powdered glass to a base (most often metal, but also glass and ceramics). The enamel then has the appearance of having been painted onto the base. The Sassanid Persians called this process 'meenakari', using brilliant coloured enamel to decorate metals, and the title referred to 'mina', the azure shade of the heavens. This art was passed on to the Mongols who diffused it to other cultures. Enamel work was also used from the late Roman Republic into the Imperial era, with traces found in Egypt, Britannia and around the Black Sea. It was also used widely for decoration on items such as idols and small monuments, as well as being common in the jewellery of the age.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eos_mint	The Kingdom of Aksum (present day Ethiopia and Eritrea) became a key player in the trade between the Roman Empire and India during the early centuries of the 1st millenium AD. As a result, it became more powerful and advanced than many of its neighbours. For instance, the Aksumites were the only nation in the region whose kings minted their own coins - a surefire indicator that a kingdom was on the rise, indicating a certain level of wealth and importance. Minted coins are also important in tracing a line of kings and often the religion they followed; Aksumite coins, for instance, denote their change in religion over the centuries, with later coins featuring a cross to mark King Ebana's conversion to Christianity during the first half of the 4th century AD.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_nomad_herders_1	Nomadism is an extremely effective way of living off areas with scarce natural resources, such as the steppes. As grazing is exhausted, herds can be moved on and the land left to recover until the following year. This is also an extremely effective and ruthless way of raising warriors. The easiest way of harvesting scarce resources is, of course, to take them from someone else. The tribe who cannot protect their own livestock, property and kin soon ceases to exist. This also encourages the worst feature of nomad life for neighbouring, settled peoples: nomads will raid and steal from weak, sedentary folk because they are just another resource to be exploited. 	true

Sol Invictus, or the 'Unconquered Sun', became the official god of the Roman Empire in AD274, during the rule of Aurelian. Sol's epithet - 'unconquered' - resonated particularly with the soldiery, who adopted him as their patron. The extent of Sol Invictus' following - the 'Solar Cult' - is evidenced through Roman coinage of the time; it bore inscriptions such as "to the unconquered sun", and the Emperors were depicted in "radiant crowns", symbolising Sol Invictus himself. Even Constantine, the first Christian Emperor, wears such a crown on his coinage. However, it was later revised to symbolise the nails of Christ's crucifixion. 	true

Orthodox Christians believe that they are following Jesus’ original teachings as presented by his Apostles. Also known as ‘Byzantine Christianity’ the Orthodox Church developed, and was shaped by, the Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire. When Theodosius became Emperor in AD 380 he was determined to return the east to Orthodox Christianity, a vision that was realised a year later. He convened the Second Ecumenical Council to further clarify matters that were discussed at the First, resulting in the condemnation of Arianism as heresy and the Orthodox Church becoming the Empire’s official faith.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_cha_bld_port_military_2	For all those states bordering the Mediterranean it was vital to command the seas around their land. Any people wishing to expand looked to control trade routes and invade other countries by sea. It was far easier to sail 1000km than march a tenth of that distance. Good ports were the key, where shipbuilding yards were found cheek-by-jowl with markets, naval garrisons and countless sea-based traders. A wharf can be anything from a single bank of masonry to a labyrinthine construction of berths, so long as at least one ship can dock successfully and unload its cargo. A military wharf is no different; a navy needs a place to resupply, re-arm and recoup in between sorties. The drydock, an inset basin that could drain and flood as necessary for the repair of ships, was devised in Ptolemaic Egypt sometime after 204BC. The drydock had numerous advantages, namely that ships no longer had to be repaired or constructed in an inopportune location before being dragged seaward for floating, providing a more stable footing upon which to build navies.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_cha_bld_treasury_3	Although the first mints appeared as early as the 7th century BC and spread swiftly around the ancient world, the concept of using coins to define value wasn't adopted by the northern tribes until much later. Prior to the 2nd century BC, bartering and payment-in-kind were widely-used by various tribes and petty kingdoms; the concept of an alternative to treasure that could be accumulated to obtain wealth was alien to the barbarian mindset. Although coins were used by the Celts from that point onwards, the first Germanic ruler to mint in his own name, and bearing his image, was Rechiar, who was king of the Suebi during the 3rd century AD. However, he had other motives aside from the stimulation of the economy, seeing minting, rightly, as a form of propaganda with which to consolidate his powerbase. Once the Vandals and Visigoths occupied former Roman territory they took over much of the ailing Empire's infrastructure, and as such began minting coins from the late 5th century onwards. At first they simply continued to mint 'pseudo-Imperial' coinage such as the 'tremissis' and 'solidus', but eventually reformed the system and produced independent currency using classic designs. Some mints even appropriated Imperial iconography, something that was undoubtedly shocking to their contemporaries but served as a blatant declaration of intent to rule in the Empire's stead.	true

Bringing everyone in a group together around a large fire kept them warm and allowed hot meals to be shared, ensuring everyone got their fair share. This in turn engendered a sense of community, kept most predators at bay, and instilled a feeling of safety amongst the tribe members. In practice, a large fire was constructed in a circle, and everyone sat around it, talking, eating, drinking, and huddling together for warmth and companionship. Of course, communal spaces also served other important purposes. Stories were passed down from generation to generation this way; tribal histories and legends gradually melded together until they became one and the same. A gathering of the entire tribal group also gave its leaders the opportunity to reveal their plans to everyone at once, and deal with any questions or concerns they may have.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_religion_celtic_minor_1	Almost without exception, all religions have the concept of a holy space, a boundary between the real world and the numinous realm of the other world. This was a place where the gods and ancestors could be consulted for guidance and approval, and ceremonies held to mark important life-changing events. Such a spot was often the home to the “soul” of a people or nation, and even the thought of its loss or despoilment was regarded with horror. The tribes of Gaul, Britannia and Germania seldom constructed buildings to their gods, preferring to use natural boundaries like riverbanks, springs, lakes or tree groves to divide the everyday world from the spiritual realm. The oak was particularly sacred; oak groves were places of great importance, where tribal matters were discussed and druids sought answers from the gods.	true

Within the urban centres, however, the economy was driven by the market and the merchant. The marketplace was a bustling hub of craftsmen plying and selling their trades; from blacksmiths to clothmakers, all earning a living and feeding the city's wealth. The markets also sold imported goods from colourful lands in the Far East, and this business was done by the merchant. Interestingly, the merchant was looked down upon by most of Sassanid Zoroastrian society, as he did not fit neatly into one of the three ideals of their religion's societal structure. The duty of procuring far off trade, then, often fell to Sogdians, Christians and ex-prisoners of war, settled in Persia and with everything to gain.	true

Indeed, early barracks were reserved entirely for elite regiments. Further examples were then constructed for more standard troops, such as the fortresses at Vercovicium and Vindolanda in Roman England. Building barracks inside fortresses made logistical sense, as troops would live and train in the place they were expected to defend. Over the centuries, the central idea of barracks changed little - in addition to living quarters, they also developed a large central courtyard for training and parading upon. As professional standing armies were smaller during the Middle Ages, barracks were less common than during later centuries, when enormous professional forces required larger building solutions.	true

Varying in style, but not in purpose, palaces of local governors, satraps and Persian royalty were power made manifest in stone. Whether based on earlier Persian designs, such as the administrative buildings and the royal palace complex at Persepolis or constructed in Hellenistic fashion by Alexander’s successors, such as the Seleucid palaces at Antioch, these buildings were designed to awe.

The later Crusades into the Holy Land are perhaps the most famous religious wars, but the Arab peoples also fought for their faith. For instance, Queen Mavia's Tanukhid rebellion against Rome was hugely successful, and saw the Roman army defeated on several occasions. When peace was finally struck, she demanded that Moses, a man well respected for his piety and said to have performed miracles, be made the first Arab bishop. As the Tanukhids were largely a nomadic people, Moses travelled with his congregation, mediating negotiations with the Romans and converting many Arabs to Christianity.	true

Monastic communities such as Kellia occupied large parts of the Nitrian Desert, their monks living remote, frugal lives stripped of the encumbrances of the civilised world. Another group, in the Scetes Desert of Egypt, were known as the "Desert Fathers", their hermit lifestyle being documented in the Apophthegmata Patrum - literally the "Sayings of the Desert Fathers".  These manuscripts act as a guide for desert hermits, focusing on spiritual practice and conveyed via a dialogue between a younger monk and his spiritual father, which may have been intended as a metaphor for the relationship between man and God.	true

The most famous of these is the site at Debre Damo, built in northern Ethiopia during the 6th century AD. The monastery complex sits atop the mountain, over 2000 metres above sea level, with an entrance embedded high in the cliff side. It is only accessible by rope, with visitors having to be winched up the side of the sheer cliff face. Another of the monastery's peculiarities is that it can only be visited by men - women are entirely and strictly forbidden. A relatively large building, the monastery is home to many religious manuscripts probably created there by the tenant monks in their isolation. The site, through some extensive maintenance work, still stands today.	true

He chose, due to an increasing number of followers and distractions, to live upon the top of a pillar in the ruins of Telanissa, with food and water being delivered to him by locals. Symeon eventually remained there for 37 years. Though it began at only a humble nine feet tall, the original pillar was replaced several times over the years, with the final one allegedly over fifty feet in height and protected by a high wall. Ironically, this determination to escape distractions resulted in even more visitors, and more frequently, as they wished to see the man on the column and ask him questions. It is said that Symeon was so famous and revered that even the Roman Emperor Theodosius II respected his words. The remains of his church - the "Qelaat Semaan" ("Fortress of Simeon") - and the base of his column still exist today, around twenty miles northwest of the city of Aleppo, in Syria.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_religion_other_1	In the ancient world, all manner of religious sects and cults existed alongside – or maybe beneath – the official state religions. Although they have undoubtedly existed since the beginning of civilisation, the word ‘cult’ is derived from something the Roman orator Cicero said, defining ‘religio’ as ‘cultus deorum’, literally ‘the cultivation of the gods’, i.e. – the necessary rituals and libations to ‘maintain’ a god, to tend and keep it ‘alive’ through worship. Many cults flourished under the surface of Roman society, including the worship of ‘Mithras’, a predominantly military cult worshipped in secret, underground spaces. The ‘Mithraic Mysteries’ remain largely mysterious to this day, as only the ‘Tauroctony’ – a scene where Mithras sits astride and slays a bull – has survived.	true

Both bards and fili had to be extremely well versed in cultural and clan history, as well as skilled at writing and delivering poetic verse. Bards were the chroniclers of both history and mythology, glorifying their culture and clan through epic poems and heroic deeds, such as the 'Táin Bó' tales and the Welsh 'Book of Taliesin'. Bards often acted as courtiers and advisors to their chieftains and kings, heaping praise upon their kin and lambasting, with sharp wit and damning satire, those who made the clan their enemy.	true

Fighting as light infantry, they were often armed with javelins or medium length spears and used shields covered in animal hide, or scaled with horn or metal. These troops also made extensive use of daggers, straight swords and the fearsome sagaris, a one-handed battle-axe, with both a bladed or hammer-like head and a pick-like point on the reverse for punching through armour. Complimenting foot archers and cavalry, their role was simply to protect the former from the latter. Far from barbarians, steppe culture, although nomadic, was a rich and diverse one.	true

More broadly, fist-fighting was a common way of settling disputes and providing entertainment. Oil-wrestling, for instance, was a type of folk wrestling practiced across eastern Europe, and is now Turkey's national sport. Another more severe type of combat was 'bear-baiting', where a man would be pitted against, predictably, a bear.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_nomad_warriors_infantry_4	Nomadic tribespeople come from the vast steppes to the north of the Black and Caspian Seas, and were known variously as Scythians or Saka, and later, Sarmatians and Huns. Fighting as light infantry, they were often armed with javelins or medium length spears and used shields covered in animal hide, or scaled with horn or metal. These troops also made extensive use of daggers, straight swords and the fearsome sagaris, a one-handed battle-axe, with both a bladed or hammer-like head and a pick-like point on the reverse for punching through armour. Complimenting foot archers and cavalry, their role was simply to protect the former from the latter. Far from barbarians, steppe culture, although nomadic, was a rich and diverse one.	true

Most knowledge of the god comes from period inscriptions, of which there are 51 across the ancient world depict Belenus .

We know of this connection due to inscriptions on unearthed offerings from such diverse places as Reims, Scotland, Mainz, Arlon and Rindern. The largest concentration of offerings to Camulos were found around Arlon, leading many historians to believe that he was of great importance to the Remi tribe that inhabited that area. He also gave his name to a large settlement in Great Britain, Camulodunum, which went on to become the modern city of Colchester. Coins have been discovered around Colchester depicting a ram-horned god that some believe to be Camulos himself.	true

Little is known about their origins or why they were constructed, but based on Celtic and tribal customs we can conclude that they may have played a part in rituals, burials and sacrifices - perhaps used to mark territory or as a memorial to an important individual. Although many were destroyed by fanatical early Christians, the sheer quantities of standing stones around the world ensured their survival to the present day. Many Britannic examples were constructed of sandstone and inscribed with images of tools and animals, of which the serpent was commonly, and prominently, featured. One of the famous sculptured stones found at Ablerlemno in eastern Scotland features a serpent on one side, with the Z-rod and double disc - another mysterious Pictish symbol - on the other.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_religion_celtic_major_1	Cairn' is a Celtic word for a pillar of stacked stones to act as a marker. Widely-used as signs for travellers from which they could find both the way there and the way back. Cairns were also, and quite often, placed at burial sites, to mark someone's passing and pay respect to the departed. In folklore, the carrying of a stone from the bottom of a valley to the top of an existing cairn is a potent custom, as referenced by the Scottish blessing "I will put a stone on your cairn". Highland folklore also states that before battle, each clansman would place a stone on a cairn and, when the battle was done, would retrieve his offering - assuming he survived the fight. The stones that remained  that were left as a monument to the dead. It is even said that the southern English region of Cornwall is named for its cairns, as many stone stacks litter its landscape.	true

Swift, cunning and nimble, he represents transitions and boundaries. Although a young god, he is second only to Dionysus. Hermes is generally depicted with the Caduceus, a winged staff with two snakes wrapped around it, representing the ease of his trade between mortal and divine planes. In the beginning, Hermes was worshipped in rural Greek regions as a god of nature until, in the 3rd century BC, he began to be understood as a teacher, passing divine knowledge down to mankind. Hermes was worshipped as a patron of athletics and gymnastics, and his image was often depicted in gymnasiums as well as in temples across Greece. A festival of games, known as Hermaea, was held annually in his honour.	true

He surrounded himself with artists and scholars, such as Alcuin of York, whom he charged with his educational reforms. The king's council hall at Aachen was the beating heart of his political and social administration - his annual addresses were forums on political and legal matters, often resulting in the creation of binding charters and capitularies. The council hall, and more broadly, palace life in the Middle Ages, was somewhere for nobles and scholars to meet and discuss the realm.

Even if not commanded by their gods, nations invoked them for strength in battle; for instance, the Romans hailing of Mars as they went to war, in the hope of divine victory. The later Crusades into the Holy Land are perhaps the most famous religious wars, but the Arab peoples also fought for their faith. For instance, Queen Mavia's Tanukhid rebellion against Rome was hugely successful, and saw the Roman army defeated on several occasions. When peace was finally struck, she demanded that Moses, a man well respected for his piety and said to have performed miracles, be made the first Arab bishop. As the Tanukhids were largely a nomadic people, Moses travelled with his congregation, mediating negotiations with the Romans and converting many Arabs to Christianity.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_barbarian_industry_forge_2	Although by the 3rd century BC the Iron Age was in full swing, bronze was often still used to make armour - for two reasons. Firstly, it could be moulded with relative ease into complex shapes just by hammering, whereas iron was brittle and therefore required the development of more advanced working techniques before it could be reliably used for the purpose. Secondly, the dominance of iron made bronze a relative rarity by this point in history. This was probably due to a shortage of the tin required for its manufacture. These two elements ensured that fine armour of bronze, despite its vulnerability to blows from iron weapons, eventually became a status symbol for its wearer. Only the wealthiest could afford it, plus  of course no one could deny that it was far more pleasing to the eye than iron - the 'ugly metal', as described by Chinese metallurgists of the time.	true

Moulds were rarely used in the ancient world to create iron weapons. Instead they employed a laborious method of smelting ore at temperatures higher than those needed for copper. The iron was then broken free from the waste slag and shaped during a lengthy process of firing and pounding.	true

The establishment of mosques throughout the Islamic world, therefore, helped to propagate education amongst the populace. These schools were known as 'maktab' and were institutions of basic education, where children were taught literacy and arithmetic, as well as the study of the Qur'an. As they grew older, they were also encouraged to study a further, more pragmatic, vocational discipline, such as medicine or a craft. This was not true of 'higher' education, however - that was the 'madrasa'. Although now a broad term for any educational institution, both religious and secular, during the Middle Ages the madrasa were purely institutions of higher education. At first, they taught only religious sciences, but over time began to allow more secular curriculums to be taught, in particular mathematics and philosophy. The focus on education during the Islamic Golden Age resulted in the Muslim world having the highest rate of literacy in the world at the time, rivalling that of ancient Greece.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_slav_wonder_civic_2_long	Unfortunately, primary sources regarding pre-Christian Slavic paganism are thin on the ground, so Svarog is first mentioned in the Hypatian Codex of the 15th century - written about a thousand years later and well into the Christian era. Svarog is the god of fire in the Slavic pantheon with both a lunar and solar aspect, each signifying different traits. As the father of the sun god, Dazbog, he is the patron of light, brightness and flames, and by extension smithing and the forge - similar to and possibly another aspect of the Greek god Hephaestus. Svarog's connection to the Greek pantheon also belies how ancient a god he is, indicating that his presence in the Slavic one may be because the Slavs eventually settled lands formerly occupied by Greek tribes in pre-Roman times. Having said that, there are evidently many connections between gods of different cultures; as such, Svarog is similar to the Sanskrit word 'svarga', meaning 'sky' or 'the heavens'. His symbol is the 'sun wheel' or 'spinning wheel' - 'kolovrat' or 'kolovratok' - used to mark graves as a symbol of eternal life, but also representing Slavic culture and paganism as a whole, in a similar way to the gammadion or swastika.	true

Early Christians suffered years of persecution at the hands of the pantheistic Romans, especially during the reigns of the emperors Domitian, Trajan and Marcus Aurelius.

Following this (for the time) extremely controversial statement, he was branded a heretic by the First Council of Nicaea in AD325, called by Emperor Constantine in an attempt to unify the church’s teachings throughout Christendom. Despite the Council’s findings, there were many who followed Arius’ teachings and they spread quickly from the academic centre of Alexandria. For instance, many of the northern barbarian tribes found Arianism a far more believable concept than traditional Catholicism. Arianism spread to such a degree that Constantine later questioned the Council’s decision, leading to Arius’ exoneration in AD335 at the First Synod of Tyre.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_cha_bld_manor_3	With the collapse the Empire, Europe of the Middle Ages evolved the Roman villa system into three elements; the feudal system, manorialism and serfdom. Feudalism divided the king's land into territories (or 'fiefs'), which were ruled by vassals in his name. Most of the land in Carolingian Europe was held 'allodially', meaning the  vassal was vested with total control and (importantly) defence of the land in the name of the king. Manorialism legitimised the power they had, as the manor became the centre of local legal and economic authority. The lord of the manor became the most important local figure, his subjects tasked with working the surrounding land of the estate.

Feudalism divided the king's land into territories (or 'fiefs'), which were ruled by vassals in his name. Most of the land in Carolingian Europe was held 'allodially', meaning the  vassal was vested with total control and (importantly) defence of the land in the name of the king. Manorialism legitimised the power they had, as the manor became the centre of local legal and economic authority. The lord of the manor became the most important local figure, his subjects tasked with working the surrounding land of the estate.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_barbarian_civic_market_2	Long before the Romans began to expand northwards, Gaul, Germania and Britannia were busily trading goods with the ‘civilised’ nations of the Mediterranean world. The complex timber trackways discovered all over Europe also belie trade links between tribes. In addition to land transport, many tribes developed ships ideally suited for use on the riverways of Europe. The Danube, Rhine, Rhone, Seine, Loire and Po rivers were all used by the barbarian cultures to transport trade goods over great distances. It is even thought that the tribes of Britannia traded with their neighbours in northern Gaul across the English Channel, although little evidence of the necessary ocean-going vessels has been discovered.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eastmig_industry_1	In the arid, uncertain world of the desert kingdoms, most people either farmed or learned a trade in order to survive. Successful agriculture was essential to facilitate many other livelihoods, so it was important to grow something likely to produce a high yield that could be sold or made into something of even greater value. Two such popular crops were cotton - to be woven into fabric - and dates, almost a staple of the region that could be eaten fresh, cooked with, and - pragmatically as sources of fresh, clean water were not guaranteed - turned into wine. Naturally, in order to achieve the quality end products that made their living, artisans developed techniques that enabled them to become highly adept at working the necessary raw materials.	true

Within the praetorium tents, war councils would convene to discuss both the army's plans and its general administration and judicial proceedings. As time went on, this more bureaucratic definition came to change the purpose of the praetorium and the term came to be applied to larger, permanent residences and palaces throughout the Eastern Roman Empire.	true

Many barrows date back to the late Neolithic period but there are more recent examples, including the famous Sutton Hoo find in Suffolk, England, which contained many elaborate grave goods.

Perhaps the most famous barbarian burial of the time was Alaric's, who was king of the Visigoths during the late 4th and early 5th century AD. After his second invasion of Italy ended in defeat, Alaric went south to invade Africa. However, Alaric died before this could happen, of a fever at the city of Cosenza in AD410. Legend has it that his people diverted the course of the Busento River to bury their king, with all his kingly trappings and spoils of war, under the river bed. Once he was safely interred the river was redirected back to its usual course, thereby covering the gravesite. In order to keep its location secret, the slaves used to dig the grave were all killed.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_all_military_upgrades_1	An army can live off the land in most places, although deserts are an obvious exception. What can’t be found, stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried with the army: arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load; medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable as opposed to just plain miserable. Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or exhausted. He will not give his best in such circumstances, no matter how inspiring the leadership qualities of his commanders.	true

The early civilisations of Sumer and Assyria also placed much importance on baskets and other wicker items, even believing them to be the children of the gods. In fact, the Mesopotamian creation legends postulate that the world was created when a wicker raft was floated upon the oceans and covered with earth to form land. The history of pottery is entwined with that of basket-making, as wicker and willow were used as moulds into which clay was poured prior to being dried in the sun or, later on, fired in ovens.

The early civilisations of Sumer and Assyria also placed much importance on baskets and other wicker items, even believing them to be the children of the gods. In fact, the Mesopotamian creation legends postulate that the world was created when a wicker raft was floated upon the oceans and covered with earth to form land. The history of pottery is entwined with that of basket-making, as wicker and willow were used as moulds into which clay was poured prior to being dried in the sun or, later on, fired in ovens.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_cha_bld_tavern_1	In antiquity, lodges and hostels emerged along popular trade routes, as a place for the weary merchant to rest after a long day of travelling. They were particularly prevalent along the eastern Silk Road - some of these stops became so popular and well used that they developed into cities in their own right, such as Palmyra. In the Middle Ages, these roadside retreats became more entrenched, yet were still a haven for the traveller. The common peasant or worker had neither the free time nor the money to spend on frivolities such as drinking. Later, as the Medieval age dawned, this changed slightly, and taverns and inns became the lively resort of anyone with a thirst for ale (everyone) and the spare money to quench it!	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_eastmig_community_sack_4	Many wars of late antiquity, particularly those of Arabia, were fought by the Roman Empire and largely nomadic, migratory peoples. The Tanukhids, a confederation of Arabic tribes with a military zeal that made them attractive to the Romans as foederati, fought in large part to survive. Their lifestyles meant that the spoils of war were simply the continuation of their favoured lifestyles, as illustrated by their revolts against Rome. The impressive Tanukhid lancers struck hard and fast, stripping many Roman settlements clean in the process and defeating the Roman army time and time again. The peace they eventually negotiated enabled the Tanukhids to dictate their terms to the Emperor Valens, who dutifully agreed.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_cha_bld_estate_1	Though the majority of the Islamic buildings in Al-Andalus have not survived, excavation and written evidence from the period have allowed us to construct a picture of villas - or 'munya' - and their function. Many were built atop old Roman sites - indeed, the Medina Azahara (one of the only surviving, if grand, examples of the munya) was built on the path of an old Roman aqueduct, which was harnessed to provide the palatial building with constant running water. The theme of water was prevalent throughout the entire ideology of Islamic villas - both as a pragmatic source for baths, and also decoratively in order to create extravagant gardens with flourishing foliage and splendid water features. Many munya were built around a central courtyard, containing monuments and features, whilst the surrounding grounds were dedicated to the gardens and monumental pools. Needless to say, these villas were resorts for noblemen and royalty when they required a lavish getaway beyond the city walls.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_religion_germanic_major_5	The Langobard's connection to Godan - better known to us as Odin - goes back to origin legends, where Godan awarded the Winnili victory in battle and named them 'Longbeards', or Langobards. After that, praise and connection with Godan remained a central tenet of their culture, manifesting in both spiritual and physical ways. The wolf warriors of the north, for instance, were spurred into action by the 'dance' of Godan. This is depicted on bronze tablets, with Godan on the left, in motion, and the wolf warrior on the right, poised for battle. Historians theorise that this dance was literal, with a tribal elder assuming the role of the god, spurring on the young wolf warriors to fight in his name.	true

As another aspect of Odin in Norse mythology, he is the foremost of the Aesir and a somewhat complicated deity. A son of giants, he presides over wisdom, philosophy, art and poetry. Wodan sacrificed himself to himself for knowledge, by hanging from the World Tree for nine days and nine nights in order to learn powerful songs and the twenty four runes of power. He also gave up one of his eyes to drink from the Well of Wisdom. Wodan is seen as the creator of the German people and the lord of magic, death and prophetic power.	true
building_flavour_texts_flavour_att_bld_religion_germanic_major_1	The practice of ritualistic animal sacrifice was prevalent throughout the tribes of the ancient world.

Bulls and boars were often linked to warriors and the aristocracy, and played an important role in the mythology of the tribes, especially the Celts.

In return, Pepin vowed to protect the Church, a notion that his son Charlemagne took a step further. He chose not only to defend the faith, but propagate it as far as he could. Charlemagne was a great reformer, and changed the structure of the Frankish Church so it was more important to the daily lives of the people and a force for good amongst local communities. During the Carolingian era, the amount of churches and cathedrals in Frankish Europe doubled, and Charlemagne's ecclesiastical reforms saw them transform from simply places of worship into educational hubs and centres for healing. The steps taken by Charlemagne through his reign - demanding education for all men alike, and bolstering the authority of the Church's leaders, helped to create the modern blueprint for the Church - as a binding agent that unifies communities.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_bel_bld_camp_workshop_1	As late antiquity progressed, and change seized the Roman Empire, so too did its military alter. The 'lorica segmentata', which was used all the way through the early Imperial period, fell out of use towards the end of the 3rd century AD due to the expense of maintenance, despite its enduring quality. However, scale and lamellar (plate) armour were still in use, and the 'lorica hamata' and 'lorica squamata' became much more prevalent amongst the Legions of the 4th century. However, the dilution of the Roman army with barbarian elements, as well as increased contact with an evolving barbarian enemy, are also seen as the causes of this change in Roman equipment. Some sources suggest that the classic Italic helmet, unchanged for centuries, underwent alterations to better deal with unconventional weapons such as axes and maces. In addition, there was a greater reliance on heavy plate armour and the emergence of new, heavy throwing weapons - such as the plumbata - to better combat this unpredictable enemy.	true

Basic literacy was the business of the few Church schools, whilst the 'scola palatina' - palatial schools - trained young nobles how to fight and behave at court. Once Charlemagne achieved victory over his immediate enemies he enacted comprehensive educational reforms, transforming the palatial schools into places of actual learning, not just for warfare and manners. However, the majority of his reforms were aimed at the Church schools, which were broadened and deepened as part of Charlemagne's 'Charter of Modern Thought'. Church leaders were vested with the responsibility to educate not only their own clergy, but also ordinary boys from their communities. They were provided with a curriculum, devised by Charlemagne, who also insisted that education was to be entirely free. In this way, he paved the way for many of Europe's modern educational systems.	true
