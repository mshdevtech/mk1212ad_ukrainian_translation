technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_judicial_power	Charlemagne's revisions to the Frankish legal system in AD780 established the position of 'scabini' - the basis for the modern legal position of 'assessor', the assistant and counsel to a judge or magistrate in most central and northern European countries. Each court was represented by seven scabini, who were, in essence, legal encyclopaedias, theoretically possessing all there was to know about Frankish and Salic law between them. These men were held in particularly high esteem and reported directly to the judge or, in many cases, passed judgement themselves based on their understanding of legal precedents. Carolingian law also forbade judges, in a bizarrely obvious move, from accepting bribes and told them to make decisions based solely on evidence and inquest. They were also to keep with them at all times a copy of the 'Lex Ripuara' -  a collection of Germanic law and the basis and inspiration for the later 'Lex Salica'.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_systemised_laws_and_taxation	Administrative and economic reform was difficult for the Shahanshah in the early days of the Sassanid empire, as the powerful noble dynasties, vying for personal power, created too much pressure to allow stable long-term reforms to take place. This allowed problems with taxation and the economy to become entrenched and stagnate. The revolt of Mazdak, however, shattered the socio-economic system of the country and entirely crushed the power of the nobility. Seizing the chance, the Shahanshah immediately put down the revolt and took control of Persia, now free of the noble's stranglehold. He implemented sweeping reforms, creating a system of administrative districts and laws, and systemised taxes and imposts in the way the house of Sassan had envisioned.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_east_civil_state_monopolies	The Eastern Roman Empire, at its peak, covered roughly 1.3 million square kilometres. The diversity of climates spanning the vast Imperial holdings ranged from Mediterranean warmth to frigid Balkan forestry, and with this came a wide variety of agricultural output. Wheat was the primary crop, being grown across the majority of the Empire, but also barley, rye and oats - especially in more northern, arid locales. Luxury items, such as olives and wine, were the key financial crops and brought in the most money. The discovery of numerous, tiny pockets of soil in the Syrian massif regions is indicative of a specialised industry there, dedicated to the cultivation and production of olives, much like the specialist vineyards scattered across the Empire. The diversity of the crops grown was used both internally and externally, sustaining both Rome and her people as well as being transported, when possible, to trading partners. As well as Empire-wide and international distribution, evidence suggests that the Near East was also a hub for prosperous local trade; the discovery of coins and pottery across the area attest to this, as does the economic survival of the region far beyond that of more distant Imperial acquisitions, such as Britannia.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_warrior_culture	Battle was an integral part of Dark Age 'barbarian' culture. Tribes frequently fought the neighbouring Germanic, Nordic, Celtic, and nomadic peoples, and even amongst themselves. Inter-tribal battles were generally fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class. Neighbouring rivals raided each other’s territory almost as sport, rather than as a serious, organised attempt to expand their boundaries. On the other hand, the wild Norsemen did so because their land couldn't produce the agricultural yields needed to feed their growing population, eventually settling in places such as England and France, where the conditions were more favourable. For the would-be warrior displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids from the age of fourteen upward. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_maintained_military_households	In his heart of hearts, the barbarian tribesman was a warrior and only a warrior. When not fighting, he was seeking out another fight. Only in battle could a man earn the glory and wealth needed to improve his position within the tribe. This was not an easy life, and only the toughest lived idly away from the battlefield. Others had to work, toiling in the fields and forests, awaiting glory that could be won in battle or by raiding against the tribe's enemies. Brought up on the traditions of feasting and raiding, young warriors craved the opportunity to prove themselves against a worthy enemy. Having scant regard for the dangers that lay ahead, whipped into frenzy by chant and song, and armed with bone-tipped spears and javelins, the ferocity of their initial attack was both feared and renowned.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_administrative_assimilation	When the Germanic peoples, chiefly the Vandals and various shades of Goth, settled in Italy and Gaul from the 5th century AD, they gradually began to adopt many of the trappings of 'civilisation'. Nothing if not practical, kings and their freeman warriors took the existing administrative structure and legal framework and adapted it for their own use. Previously, legal precedents were required to be held in advocates' - called 'rachimburgs' by the Franks - memories, leading to wildly inconsistent and subjective judgements. Whereas these tribal traditions of oral advocacy worked for a culture constantly on the move, now they had settled tribal laws were adapted to serve the people as a whole, rather than merely resolving conflicts between individuals. As it happened, the barbarians had inherited an administrative system that had been in place for many years, during which many of its peculiarities had been worked out. This made it simpler to 'Germanise' existing Roman laws and 'Latinise' elements of their own at the same time, in the process codifying everything within a single document. Written in Latin, the 'Codex Euricianus', or 'Code of Euric' was probably the first record of its kind; produced around AD480, it is a set of legal rulings and precedents compiled on the orders of the Visigothic king Euric II, who ruled parts of northern Spain and southern France around Toulouse during the 5th century AD. This legal landmark was swiftly followed by the publication of the Frankish 'Lex Salica', around AD500, and the  'Lex Romana Visigothorum', or 'Breviary of Alaric', in AD506. 	true

Sheep, cows, horses, and camels were commonly raised for export, and grains were the main crop grown. In Aksum, ivory from elephant and rhinoceros horns became luxury items as far afield as Rome, Sassanid Persia, and India, which led to intensive hunting of those creatures. In addition, the Aksumite kings built up a network of internal trade routes to make sure goods got to the coast and onto trade ships at the bustling port of Adulis as quickly and efficiently as possible.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_call_vassals	If the collapse of the Roman Empire made one thing clear, it was that life would never – could never – be the same as it had been for centuries prior. The barbarian kingdoms that swept away Rome's remnants assumed much of its workable infrastructure, particularly that relating to the organisation of the armed forces. By offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, loyalty could be secured. The kingdoms of the late Dark and early Middle Ages were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to aspire to. Members were obligated to fight for the king and provide troops from their own retinues whenever he called them to do so. In return, they were given lands and titles under the proviso that they enforced the king's laws and offered protection to the peasants who worked their lands. In real terms, this was a license to behave in almost any way the vassals liked - they had the weapons and the training to make any point they so chose; the serfs, on the other hand, had none of those things, and therefore no chance to rise up and change their situation.	true

In recent years, many complex, beautiful artefacts that attest to this have been discovered during archaeological excavations. Through the study of their distinctive patterns it has been possible to piece together a timeline of the emergence and expansion of the production methods and technology used. By specialising in a particular skill or craft, a man's worth increased exponentially, and the items he produced became far more valuable than the cost of the materials used. This, in turn, guaranteed a livelihood for many.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_imperial_church	Before Christianity, it was believed that the gods were responsible for every worldly and otherworldly happening. Investigation into more natural solutions revealed preliminary understanding of atomics, which fed into understanding of the elements. As the Romans conquered their philosophy expanded to become self-aggrandising; Rome conquered, thus Rome was right. Great edifices to their glory, and to the gods, were erected from concrete in impressively short timeframes. Christianity, and the notion of the Emperor's semi-divinity, later bolstered the self-absorbed notion of Roman philosophy and its outlook on the world -  the Emperor was charged with the task of uniting the world, in the name of God! This notion persisted among the barbarian kingdoms which followed the Empire, into the Middle Ages and beyond - the monarch was chosen by God himself to rule on His behalf. 	true
technologies_long_description_cha_frank_military_battlefield_medicine	The dawning of the Middle Ages brought with it advances and adventurous forays into the rapidly growing world of medicine and surgery. In the 7th century AD, the Greek physician Paul of Aegina wrote the 'Medical Compendium in Seven Books', a compilation of the medical studies and practises of other scholars, including theories and advanced (for the time) surgical procedures. Although surgery did not take hold for many  centuries to come, the techniques discussed and pioneered during the early Middle Ages were used to help bandage up soldiers so they could continue fighting. Rudimentary approaches to amputation, also, were used to remove mangled or infected limbs, although the victim's chances of survival were extremely slim. The surgeon was in the business of patching up warriors; later, if wounds became infected and resulted in death, that was simply none of his concern.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_heavy_cavalry_tactics_east	As the Roman Empire divided and struggled into late antiquity, one of the chief problems its army had to address was cavalry, which was greatly inferior compared to that of its enemies. The Hunnic and barbarian hordes that swept down from the steppes did so on horseback, and to the east the Sassanid Persian armies smashed their foes apart with their decisive heavy cataphracts. Rome was slow to adapt to the changing face of mounted warfare, as their chief allies primarily fielded foot soldiers. After initially resisting the need for change, the Empire finally started to develop new cavalry types that could effectively challenge eastern cataphracts and nomadic lancers. The Eastern Romans, particularly, developed the clibinarii based on the eastern cataphracts, as a response to the threat posed by the unstoppable Sassanid charge. Clibanarii and catafractarii wore head to foot mail or scale armour and carried long 'kontos' lances to unseat mounted opponents and smash through infantry lines.	true

The Eastern Roman Empire, particularly, developed the clibinarii based on the eastern cataphracts, as a response to the threat posed by the unstoppable Sassanid charge. There is some debate amongst historians as to when cavalry achieved superiority over infantry, beginning the paradigm shift leading to the eventual rise of mounted knights and their dominance of the battlefield. Many believe it started at the Battle of Adrianople when the power of the Gothic heavy cavalry swept the Romans' heavy infantry from the field. However, many centuries passed before the medieval knights' spectacular war-winning combination of heavy horse and armour became the norm. 	true

Also known as 'miniature', from the Latin 'minium' (red lead), used for colouring along with other pigments like vermillion. By the time of late antiquity, papyrus had fallen out of use as a writing surface in favour of the more durable and lasting parchment or vellum, which were carefully prepared before being written upon. Vellum, made from calfskin and usually used for higher-quality texts, was soaked in water and lime and left to dry for several days. Afterwards, excess hair was removed and the skin framed and pressed. Finally, the sheet of vellum was rubbed with a flat object to allow ease of writing; the vellum was then fit for purpose.	true

For example, Charlemagne was determined to reform the Frankish Kingdom's educational system in favour of broader educational institutions, so that a greater proportion of his subjects could be educated. He did this by inviting Alcuin, a scholar from York, to his court at Aachen, along with Peter of Pisa and others. Alcuin became Charlemagne's 'prime minister of education' and held sway in all scholastic matters for the entire realm, as well as personally tutoring the king. Later, Charlemagne decreed the 'Charter of Modern Thought', with the view that every boy should be given a basic education, not just the sons of the noble elite.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_specialisation_of_functions	It was Constantine the Great who, in the 4th century AD, reformed the Roman army from the system that had been in place since the 2nd. In many ways, Constantine built on the initiatives of earlier Emperors such as Gallienus and even Severus, more clearly defining the roles of the standing Imperial army, and increasing its overall size significantly. The reforms established firm roles, such as comitatenses and limitanei - roaming armies and frontier troops respectively. This, in conjunction with the general reduction in size of individual Imperial armies, indicated Constantine's trend  of creating specialised function, also shown in the specific names of units such as lanciarii, clibinarii and balistarii. It also promoted regionalisation, as limitanei forces would dig in at their locations like a garrison force, whereas the smaller comitatenses forces would deploy as needed to provinces throughout the empire. Constantine's reforms further delineated the previously homogenous approach, instead creating smaller clusters that reduced his armies' logistical cost; each force was sent only where it was needed, reducing frivolous expenditure and placing it nearer to necessary production facilities.	true

Although it had been taken with relative ease the general realised that not only would he need to defend it against the Ostrogoths immediately, but also commit to a comprehensive and speedy program of reconstruction of the city's defences. The ditches around the city had to be cleared, the walls rebuilt and the garrison fortified. To aid in this, Belisarius enlisted into the army groups of workmen who were redundant since the siege had ended. They were formed into fighting squadrons and given pay and duties as an additional garrison, fulfilling both Belisarius' military needs and preventing any would-be rioters among them from entertaining seditious thoughts.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_civil_open_markets	Eventually, no matter where they came from, goods had to end up at market in order to be sold. As such, markets sprang up close to natural harbours, and where rivers forked or roads met - and naturally settlements followed. Although the marketplaces themselves became semi-permanent spaces, what was sold very much depended on what was available in quantity, what could be transported, or what caught the eye of a particular trader at a particular time. At this point in history, and somewhat unsurprisingly, supply and demand operated only in the most basic of forms. Bearing in mind the time and distances involved, and knowledge of the outside world required, there was no guarantee that what a customer wanted would be available next time, or indeed that either party would be present or even still alive when the next market was held. Gradually, over time, settlements grew up around markets as it made sense to live close to your means of income.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_agricultural_diversity	As populations boomed the demand for food increased, driving farmers to use more intensive farming techniques. Technology played its part, with improved tools and the domestication of large animals to pull advanced and effective ploughs. Larger labour forces and the growth of other techniques, such as terraced farming, opened up new areas for cultivation. The construction of more complex canals and dams helped to turn arid landscapes into well-irrigated farming plots.	true

technologies_long_description_att_slav_civil_the_slavic_code_venedi	When the barbarian tribes settled, from the 5th century AD, they gradually began to adopt many of the trappings of 'civilisation'. Nothing if not practical, kings and their free warriors took the existing administrative structure and legal framework and adapted it for their own use. Previously, legal precedents were required to be held in 'advocates' - memories - leading to wildly inconsistent and subjective judgements. Whereas tribal traditions of oral advocacy worked for cultures constantly on the move, tribal laws were adapted to be societal - serving the people as a whole rather than merely resolving isolated conflicts between individuals. As it happened, the barbarians inherited an administrative system that had been in place for many years, during which many of its peculiarities had already been ironed out.	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_barbarian_recruits	Diocletian's military reforms ushered in many changes. Chief among them was more than doubling the number of Legions, and thus increasing the capacity of the army. These reforms came at a time when Romans were becoming more and more cynical and reluctant towards the military, with a much-reduced rate of sign-ups despite the attractive wage. To combat this, the state implemented a series of recruitment measures, such as hereditary service and a compulsory levy for landowners. However, these strategies were only mildly effective. A more dangerous but common strategy was the recruitment of barbarians into the army, often drawing on defeated enemies and those outside of the Empire to fill the otherwise sparse Roman ranks. In the Western Empire, this reliance was their undoing, as the unruly and displaced tribes took liberties that gradually eroded the Western Roman state. In the east, the Emperors kept a much tighter control on the balance of their armed forces, ensuring no one power could establish dominance of the military. The Eastern Roman army survived where the West fell because the Emperor maintained this optimal fighting force.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_english_civil_trade_goods	Whilst those parts of Europe inside the boundaries of the Roman Empire prospered during antiquity, due to the great roads and merchant fleets built to facilitate commerce, northern, Germanic Europe generally languished in relative isolation. This was only made worse by the movement of the Roman capital further east to Constantinople in the 4th century AD, and the great climate change that ravaged the crops and natural wealth of much of northern and eastern Europe during the Migration Period. By the 7th century AD, however, the Merovingian Frankish kings began revitalising trade in northern Europe with a fair at St. Denis, which connected cities across the northern continent, mainly via old Roman roads and the network of rivers that lattice Europe. As the climate change abated, ports and river villages began to become important trade hubs once again, and none more so than the city of Dorestad. Ideally positioned between the Franks and the Frisians, it allowed merchants a convenient half-way point to meet and do business. Its value, however, dragged it into a battle for power between the two, a conflict that widened as the Middle Ages progressed, ultimately leading to the downfall of Dorestad as a major trading city.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_civil_irrigation_techniques	Agriculture was - and remains - a difficult endeavour. Water is the crucial factor: rivers and flood plains might be good for growing crops, but a flood can wash away good soil instead of renewing the land. In more arid areas, farmers are reliant on canals and qanats for irrigation, and water must be managed carefully. Basic irrigation systems were widespread in the ancient world because they were simple to maintain. Perennial irrigation was rarer, and required longer canal systems, a method of storage, and better maintenance to ensure that silt and salt build-up was kept in check. For example, in sun-scorched Mesopotamia the river system was able to supply water to the surrounding arable land in the dry season through a system of canals, closed off by dykes and sluice gates. Water was stored in reservoirs, either natural or man-made, and then lifted into the irrigation channels. While this was a labour-intensive task, the results of such toil were remarkable and hugely beneficial to harvests in the area.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_martial_culture_frankish	Battle was an integral part of the various barbarian cultures of antiquity. Tribes of all ethnicities fought the neighbouring Celts, Germans, Slavs, Norsemen, Greeks, nomads and, above all others, the expansionist, imperialist Romans. Amongst themselves, tribes fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class or two nominated champions facing off in single combat. For the would-be warrior, displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids once they had reached manhood. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true
technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_military_official_inspections	As time passed and the economies of the desert kingdoms grew, a greater degree of control was exerted by central government than ever before. Up to that point, the administration of government was far more ad hoc, with the local nobility controlling much of the machinery of state, and little consistency in policy between neighbouring provinces. Corruption amongst the tribal leaders was rife as a result, so centralisation was considered necessary in order to reduce it and guarantee a continuous stream of wealth into the royal coffers. For instance, in the Kingdom of Aksum, government viceroys were appointed to work alongside local officials to ensure that the king’s directives were adhered to.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_west_civil_barbarian_enclaves	The Roman Empire was a vast, sprawling array of territories either directly controlled by the state or semi-autonomously governed and promising support and tribute. Whilst some of these could be trusted to act in accordance with Imperial demands, there were some who never truly accepted Roman dominion. The Gauls, as well as the Celtiberians, were two such groups who remained almost perennially belligerent towards their overlords. Further away, in Arabia, there is evidence that limitanei forces were stationed far away from main trade routes and frontiers, which implies they were sent to keep order, much like the occupying forces of Gaul once were. Imperial military presence in unruly settlements helped to maintain order, and keep trade and production moving where it might otherwise stagnate.	true
technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_serfdom	Serfdom was an institution built upon a long history of oppression. Serfs were peasants, as organised under the developing, proto-feudal system of late antiquity. They lived in servitude, attached to an estate and to the lord or owner of that estate in a condition of bondage known as 'manorialism'. Whilst the status of the Helots in ancient Sparta was similar to that of serfs (though much more severe) it was the labour shortage in the Roman Empire during the 3rd century AD that gave rise to serfdom. In response to the crisis, tenant farmers were employed instead of slaves. However, their social conditions steadily degraded; legislation in AD332 by Emperor Constantine tied 'coloni' to their land and greatly restricted their rights, transforming an already corrupt, abusive relationship into something akin to slavery.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_conquerors	The early Middle Ages was a time defined by fledgling European nations, attempting to find purchase in a world still trying to drag itself out of the chaos of the Dark Ages. The Lombards, Saxons and Avars wanted to make a safe home for their people, yet the Franks under Charlemagne were dogmatic about expanding and spreading their culture and religion across the world. Charlemagne, though a conqueror, was unusually (for the time) concerned with the welfare and wellbeing of his subjects, enacting sweeping educational, administrative and religious reform aimed at educating and healing local communities. He extended this policy to his conquered territories, as long as they abandoned paganism and embraced Christianity as their faith. Broadly the same policy was enacted by the Umayyad Caliphate, although they were notably far more tolerant of other faiths amongst their conquered peoples than Charlemagne. As a counterpoint to this, the Viking excursions and raids across the northern European shores and the British Isles were concerned not with the sentiments of the local populace, but only with the personal gain and glory of the Vikings. They, too, were looking for a place to settle and call home, but they cared little for the people they displaced in order to do so.	true
technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_mercenary_employment_strategies	The Roman army and its use of mercenaries is well documented, especially the use of barbarian tribesmen. However, this practice was not limited to the Romans; barbarian tribes often sought assistance from their neighbours in times of need. When the Goths became trapped in the northern Balkans in AD377 they recruited Huns and Alans to remove the Roman garrison that was blocking the passes of the Haemus Mons range. In return for saving the Goths from certain starvation, the steppe mercenaries were promised their fair share of plunder, an arrangement that pleased all involved, except for the Romans of course!	true

He enacted many sweeping reforms in order to achieve his aim of bettering education, including the development of a standardised 'miniscule' script, or handwriting, that he intended would be fully recognisable right across Europe. It was based on the Roman 'uncial' and 'cursive' scripts, that were then further developed to be very rigid and unchanging, and therefore extremely neat and highly legible. The development of this handwriting introduced many font conventions that are considered standard today - word spacing, capitalisation, etc. Although Charlemagne himself was unable to write (though he tried to learn), his miniscule script was, in many ways, the first real style guide in the western world.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_civil_water_power	Before the advent of industrial mechanisation and electric power, harnessing the power of flowing water was the most effective method of generating energy for industry and agriculture. Water wheels and mills were known to have been used throughout ancient Rome and India, whereby the flow of a river (or, in Medieval times, the tide) turns gears and belts to generate power for irrigation. A process known as 'hushing' was developed during the 1st century AD and had been widely adopted by the dawn of the Middle Ages. Hushing is the deliberate and targeted use of torrents of water to wash away layers of soil and debris around seams so that they could be mined, with a sluice gate opened to control the strength of the water flow. In an era before explosives, hushing was an excellent method of revealing the minerals and wealth of the earth - and is still used to some extent in cases where explosives are deemed too destructive to the area being mined.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_civil_moorish_architecture	The Moors - Muslims who lived in the Maghreb and the Iberian Peninsula - experienced something of an architectural revolution during the Umayyad occupation of Al-Andalus. The distinctive style of Moorish arches, courtyards, ornate tilework and muqarnas masonry gave their buildings a distinctive appearance. One of the most enduring examples is the Great Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba. The first Umayyad Emir, Abd al-Rahman I, desired to create a mosque to rival the holiness and importance of Mecca, and outshine any mosque in Baghdad and Jerusalem. The cathedral has a famous, and distinctive 'hypostyle' hall - the ceiling is held up by over 850 columns made from a wealth of different materials, including onyx, marble and granite.	true
technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_regional_defence_force	Due to their early interactions with the Romans it was thought that many of the tribes of Europe were not seafarers, partially because no ships dating to that period have ever been discovered but also because the Romans never discussed it in their written accounts. This changed during the Migration Period. Tribes such as the Vandals took to the sea and conquered vast swathes of territory, so much so that the Mediterranean became known as the ‘Wendelsea’, or ‘Sea of the Vandals’. This meant that other tribes were forced defend their coasts against them; there is even evidence that the western Irish peoples set up patrols to intercept enemy vessels, protecting themselves from raids and invasions.	true

This often led to infighting and, in the case of the Visigoths, civil war. It wasn’t until Euric became king that he was able to defeat many of the powerful chieftains and unite them under one leader. With this new found power, Euric expanded the bounds of his territory into Hispania; by the time of the Western Roman Empire's collapse he had taken control of most of the Iberian Peninsula, all except Galatia. On his death the Visigoths also controlled around a third of Gaul, although they eventually lost all their holdings in the south of the country due to the relentless expansion of the neighbouring Frankish Empire.	true

It was the kingdom of Wessex, in the south of England, that first subdivided its lands further, into shires and boroughs - a style that soon caught on as Mercia ascended to a position of influence over the other Anglo-Saxons. The Mercians charged ealdormen (the root of the more contemporary 'earl') with the governance of shires. Although the word has fallen out of use in favour of counties, their influence can still be found in county names such as Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Lancashire.	true

However, because of the biannual migration to new pastures common amongst the steppe tribes, such a move was nothing new. Nevertheless, the migration of an entire people was no small undertaking. Ultimately, the promise of the wealth and treasures to be gained by conquering Rome was too tempting to be ignored, and spurred the Huns onwards.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_judicial_power	Charlemagne's revisions to the Frankish legal system in AD780 established the position of 'scabini' - the basis for the modern legal position of 'assessor', the assistant and counsel to a judge or magistrate in most central and northern European countries. Each court was represented by seven scabini, who were, in essence, legal encyclopaedias, theoretically possessing all there was to know about Frankish and Salic law between them. These men were held in particularly high esteem and reported directly to the judge or, in many cases, passed judgement themselves based on their understanding of legal precedents. Carolingian law also forbade judges, in a bizarrely obvious move, from accepting bribes and told them to make decisions based solely on evidence and inquest. They were also to keep with them at all times a copy of the 'Lex Ripuara' -  a collection of Germanic law and the basis and inspiration for the later 'Lex Salica'.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_wooden_wall	As society developed, the need for larger settlements to house more people increased. This gave rise to fortified settlements, which tended to be built on areas with natural defences such as hilltops, cliffs or river bank with stone or wooden defences added, which set them apart from smaller tribal settlements. Some historians argue that the addition of fortifications was not a defensive decision but was, in fact, a matter of prestige.	true
technologies_long_description_att_slav_civil_elite_dominance_venedi	'Elite Theory' is a sociological paradigm that exists as strongly today as in antiquity. By its most basic definition, the theory proposes that the powerful and the wealthy - the 'elite' - form a ruling minority in society, responsible for all the decision-making within their social structure. In contemporary society, these are generally issues of economic and political direction, but during antiquity this dominance would have had much greater influence – which gods were worshipped, for instance, all the way down to how people spoke and which words were used. The culture of entire tribes, as well as their linguistic development, could be altered by a relative minority. For instance, if a ruling elite used a different language to the 'lesser' majority, it is conceivable that their cultural and linguistic preferences would be imprinted upon the rest of the population, forcing a slow but gradual shift in their societal development.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_hereditary_service	As the Roman Republic bloomed, and then transformed into Empire, the state was very much a militarised society, with every aspect of Roman life facilitating the army. As the Empire staggered through the 3rd century crisis, nearly imploding under the weight of war and corruption, a gulf emerged between the civilian and military populace. This was exacerbated when Emperor Diocletian divided military and civilian governance into separate bodies, creating numerous stand-off situations between administrators, generals and even the Emperor himself. The changing nature of the armed forces, particularly in the eyes of the common Roman, was such that military service was seen as an unattractive occupation, despite the good wage. This problem was acutely worsened by Diocletian's decision to double the number of Legions. Hereditary service, as well as conscription, became vital to sufficiently man the armed forces. Landowners were charged with providing quotas of men to maintain Diocletian's swelling ranks.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_new_aristocracy	If the collapse of the Roman Empire made one thing clear, it was that life would never – could never – be the same as it had been for centuries prior. The barbarian kingdoms that swept away Rome's remnants assumed much of its workable infrastructure, particularly that relating to the organisation of the armed forces. Of course, this also gave them a means of controlling the young, educated class who might otherwise fight against the new regimes; by offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, their loyalty could be secured. The kingdoms of the late Dark and early Middle Ages were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to be aspired to. Members were obligated to fight for the king, and provide troops from their own retinues, whenever he called them to do so. In return, they were given lands and titles under the proviso they enforced the king's laws and offered protection to the peasants who worked them. In real terms, this was a license to behave in almost any way they liked - the vassals had the weapons and the training to make any point they so chose; the serfs, on the other hand, had none of those things, and therefore no chance to rise up and change their situation. 	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_civil_church_music	The music of the Christian Church, an essential part of its ceremony, comes from its Jewish forebears, as indeed do many of its rituals and rites. Although debated by scholars, some think the Psalms - integral parts of the Jewish faith - are the origin of both Jewish and Catholic religious song. However, in the middle of the 1st century AD, singing was frowned upon until the development of the church organ in approximately the 7th century, not long after the introduction of the Gregorian chant. Although commonly thought to be a Carolingian invention; a melding together of Roman and Gallic chants, legend attributes it to Pope St. Gregory the Great. Gregorian chant is known for its melisma - the singing of a single syllable over several musical notes - and its characteristic fluctuating melody. In the Middle Ages, singers were urged to extol the virtues of restraint and piety, as befit the message of the Church at that time. This is in opposition to modern Gregorian chants, which are primarily used for mood-setting and atmospherics, particularly when sung with a full choir.	true

The Sassanids, who were the premier power in the near east before the Caliphate, considered law and religion intrinsic to each other; their god Zoroaster was the arbiter of justice who presided over legal affairs through his priesthood. Likewise, the law of the Caliphate considered religious and legal matters one and the same, and also controlled everyday practices such as fasting and hygiene. As a result, religion and society were bound together - with Islamic law thought to be the immutable word of God.	true

This meant arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load, medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable, as opposed to just plain miserable. Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or exhausted. He will not give his best in such circumstances, no matter how inspiring the leadership qualities of his commanders.	true

By the 4th century AD barbarian kings could no longer rely on voluntary support to fuel their military campaigns, forcing them to find the finances to raise and support their armies. For many of the barbarian tribes their most lucrative assets were agricultural, making farms an obvious target for additional taxes in times of need. Both the Alamanni and Tervingi tribes are known to have levied taxes on agricultural production to pay for the support of their king’s military retinue. 	true

They continued to practice votive offerings, depositing items at sacred places to gain the grace of the gods, or to ask favours of them, even vengeance. Pagans worshipped the natural world and the spirits of the land, with whom they tried to communicate by casting offerings into the water or burying them for the earth to claim. Even upon their grudging conversion to Christianity, in the late first century, peoples such as the Saxons continued to practice paganism, using gold and precious substances to gain the favour of the One God, or perhaps more duplicitously to appear as if that was the case.	true

As antiquity subsided into the Middle Ages, blacksmiths remained ubiquitous: every village and town of note had a smithy turning out anything the community needed. Smithing also encouraged trade, as the iron needed to create steel was not always a local resource. Iron gave warriors an edge in combat, often quite literally; it allowed weapons and armour of greater strength to be forged.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_specialised_industry	Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, much of the infrastructure that mass-produced goods for Imperial consumption remained in place. However, its successor kingdoms lost none of the barbarians’ flair for producing beautiful, crafted objects that exhibited highly-advanced skills with wood, metal and precious stones. In recent years, many complex, beautiful artefacts that attest to this have been discovered during archaeological excavations. Through their study it has been possible to piece together a timeline of the emergence and expansion of the production methods and technology used. By specialising in a particular skill or craft, a man's worth increased exponentially, and the items he produced became far more valuable than the cost of the materials used. This, in turn, guaranteed a livelihood for many.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_cultural_integration	The reason for Attila's conquest of Europe, and the avalanche of displacement he began, is theorised to have occurred for many possible reasons; climate change, transhumanism or the desire for conquest, yet his ambition cannot be seen as wholly culturally motivated. In fact, Attila embraced an even greater cultural tolerance than eastern nations like the Sassanids, who were accepting of all so long as their laws were obeyed. His aspirations were motivated by a desire for power, for riches and for living space for the Hunnic people. Therefore, those tribes that were amalgamated into his growing empire were welcomed, providing they did all that Attila asked of them. This tolerance of other cultures, combined with Attila's far-ranging conquests, meant cultural osmosis was inevitable as the Huns impacted on their clients and vice versa. For instance, from excavation it is impossible to tell the difference between tools fashioned by the Germanic and Hunnic cultures of the period. Further, the Huns came to learn the Germanic language out of necessity, as well as dress like their barbarian subjects, but that may have been due to the cold weather gripping Europe at the time. It indicates that the Hunnic empire became a fusion of the various steppe nomads and barbarian cultures it encompassed. The way to prosperity was clearly tied to the appropriation of Hunnic culture, and to make oneself as Hun-like as possible. The identity of a man, therefore, became a premium commodity; as the Germanic tribes that were the bulk of Attila's European army became Hunnic, the Huns in turn, became more European.	true

This often led to infighting and, in the case of the Visigoths, civil war. It wasn’t until Euric became king that he was able to defeat many of the powerful chieftains and unite them under one leader. With this new found power, Euric expanded the bounds of his territory into Hispania; by the time of the Western Roman Empire's collapse he had taken control of most of the Iberian Peninsula, all except Galatia. On his death the Visigoths also controlled around a third of Gaul, although they eventually lost all their holdings in the south of the country due to the relentless expansion of the neighbouring Frankish Empire.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_west_civil_intermarriage_regulations	The late Roman Empire was marked by an increase in hereditary work, both in the military and also civilian industries. In the military, hereditary service was resumed to bring more people into its ailing ranks, whilst in the civilian sector the attraction of 'collegia' (legal associations) for workforces drew children to follow in their parent's footsteps. Hereditary craftsmanship was common as a child would, unless taught otherwise, learn the profession of his father, and then in turn pass that knowledge to his own children.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_militia	In their original form, militias were simply warriors who adhered to the principles of combat. However, over time they evolved from their Roman roots to mean part-time military forces used for the defence of cities or towns. Before the centralisation of government and the military in the later Middle Ages, noblemen from individual provinces were responsible for fielding troops during wartime, and also the militias that remained behind. The Emirate armies of Cordoba relied on Berber and Andalusian natives for their militias - the veterans of the Syrian garrisons were better suited to forming the core of the emir's standing armies. The Anglo-Saxon system of 'fyrd' and 'select' recruitment perfectly encapsulates the notion of armies and militias during this period - those who did not get drafted into the army to fight their king's wars stayed behind to make their villages safe. Redoubts were strengthened, militias formed, and barricades erected so settlements were fully prepared should the war come to them.	true

Each court was represented by seven scabini, who were, in essence, legal encyclopaedias, theoretically possessing all there was to know about Frankish and Salic law between them. These men were held in particularly high esteem and reported directly to the judge or, in many cases, passed judgement themselves based on their understanding of legal precedents. Carolingian law also forbade judges, in a bizarrely obvious move, from accepting bribes and told them to make decisions based solely on evidence and inquest. They were also to keep with them at all times a copy of the 'Lex Ripuara' -  a collection of Germanic law and the basis and inspiration for the later 'Lex Salica'.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_royal_minting_programme	According to some ancient commentators, the origin of the coin is the eastern kingdom of Lydia. As controlling the source of coinage bestowed economic benefits, the crude electrum coins were rapidly adopted and developed by the Greek cities and Persians alike. The ‘Darik’, struck by King Darius, showed the king running with a weapon and became the standard across the east until the Alexander’s Macedonian invasion, following which more ornate Greek designs featuring portraits and deities appeared. This new coinage was seen as a potent symbol of power by eastern kings who quickly minted their own versions.	true
technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_reformed_capitation_tax	Administrative and economic reform was difficult within the desert kingdoms of African and Arabia, as the power of their kings was shored-up by alliances between tribes and confederations all vying for what they saw as their fair share of the generated wealth, and of course the higher status that went with it – whether it was the best thing for the kingdom or not. The advent of defined currencies in gold, silver, bronze and electrum improved matters somewhat, as it was no longer as easy to argue about what something was worth, and therefore how much tax should be paid to the crown. The development of coinage was also symptomatic of the vast amounts of frankincense, myrrh, copper, ivory, glassware, and slaves being traded, so organised tax calculation and collection systems were necessary just to keep officials aware of (most of) what was going on.	true

By the 7th century AD, however, the Merovingian Frankish kings began revitalising trade in northern Europe with a fair at St. Denis, which connected cities across the northern continent, mainly via old Roman roads and the network of rivers that lattice Europe. As the climate change abated, ports and river villages began to become important trade hubs once again, and none more so than the city of Dorestad. Ideally positioned between the Franks and the Frisians, it allowed merchants a convenient half-way point to meet and do business. Its value, however, dragged it into a battle for power between the two, a conflict that widened as the Middle Ages progressed, ultimately leading to the downfall of Dorestad as a major trading city.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_long_marches	During late antiquity, there was little attempt by the European powers to stratify and organise their forces in the same way as the Roman army. In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

However, as time went on, it helped to cripple them as they were forced tor rely more and more on barbarian federate forces to fight their wars for them. Proximity to the Empire often meant that it was simply a matter of time before a people came into their sphere of influence, and so it was with the Slavs. The Anteans, close to Eastern Roman borders, were offered foederati status in exchange for gold and military service - a bulwark against the marauding steppe nomads. As a result, the Romans gifted the Anteans a fort on the strategically important Danube river.

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_hard_training	The armies of the early Middle Ages were built upon a strong backbone of elite troops, drawn from the noble and aristocratic classes. These men generally had the best armour, the best weapons and the best horses. They hunted, trained against dummies and each other, and were primed and ready for war whenever it came. However, they alone were too small a force to form a real standing army, and so levies padded out their numbers. Mustered together by regional lords and vassals to the king, levied troops were trained as well as individual lords could afford. This meant that the quality of levies, whilst never exceptional, varied from place to place - some were afforded weapons and armour by their masters, whereas others had to make do with what they could find at home or, worse, on the battlefield. Some lords also relied on mercenaries - often roaming tribes of barbarians who fought for coin - to sharpen their forces with a battle-hardened edge.	true

Visigothic rule was mostly focused on military and agricultural development to sustain the economy, but the caliphates were much more interested in revitalising the country's potential. As well as being a major production centre for silver, the Muslims developed Spain's textiles industry by bringing the cotton plant to the region and turning Al-Andalus into a powerhouse of silk manufacture.

Tribes of all ethnicities fought the neighbouring Celts, Germans, Slavs, Norsemen, Greeks, nomads and, above all others, the expansionist, imperialist Romans. Amongst themselves, tribes fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class or two nominated champions facing off in single combat. For the would-be warrior, displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids once they had reached manhood. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true

The 'Codex Theodosianus', as it was known, took 22 experts nine years to pull together across sixteen volumes, and represented the majority of Rome's legal framework, codified for first time since the foundation of the 'Twelve Tables'. It was not without problems, however. The Codex was hard to properly research, with laws changing even as they were being written. Delays in acquiring information from Rome, Ravenna and private collections made editing it a frustrating process. Nevertheless, the Codex represented a major breakthrough in the documentation of Roman legal processes. It also increased state authority on religious matters, expanding on Christianity's decriminalisation under Constantine and solidly positioning it as Rome's official state religion; one that was intrinsically linked to the role of Emperor.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_military_siege_stores	Sieges in the Dark and early Middle Ages were varied affairs - they either ended in a short, bloody battle, or settled into protracted situations of more devious strategies and classic blockade warfare. For the defenders, they were often secure in the knowledge that an enemy assault on the walls would be easy for them to repel. On the other hand, attackers knew that starving out the defenders may take time but would likely result in ultimate victory. However, it was only after increased contact with the enemy that they truly learned. Roman siege techniques, and the technology that went with them, took hold elsewhere as the art of urban warfare developed. Many powers kept secret supply networks and vast stores of food in preparation for drawn-out assaults. Much of this went unnoticed, allowing their armies to outlast the enemy on each occasion. 	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_long_marches	During late antiquity, there was little attempt by the European powers to stratify and organise their forces in the same way as the Roman army. In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_military_universal_combat_training	In the ancient world, it was sometimes deemed necessary to supplement trained forces with a levy of largely untrained men, usually to pin down or distract the enemy sufficiently for the professional troops to outflank them. In times of need, levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army - whether citizens or subjects. Eastern armies, for example, were created by command of the king, who ordered his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. The nobles or local dignitaries brought their households, attendant warriors, and levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_fyrd_levy	When the Anglo-Saxon Mercian kings went to war, they called their bannermen to fight with them. Whilst there would be a retinue of thegns to form an elite guard, the bulk of their armies had to come from elsewhere. The common folk of the country, known as the 'fyrd', were the answer. Levying freemen was a tradition from the Mercian's Germanic roots that had endured, and the fyrd fought if not for their king then for their home. Originally, all able-bodied freemen were expected to fight but it quickly became evident that whilst away from their homes, nobody could tend to crops or push the economy along, especially if a war became protracted. Likewise, if too many men died, there would be nobody to work the land when the war was over. From this, the Anglo-Saxons developed the 'select' system, where only certain men - those considered most able for the purpose - would be drafted into the army, whilst the rest would remain and see to the business of keeping the country, not just the army, going for the duration of hostilities.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_craft_specialisation	When the steppe nomads were not on the move, it was essential they found shelter for themselves, their families, livestock and all the items carried with them to make life tolerable in such a harsh, unforgiving environment. The best way to achieve this was by bringing their homes with them; as such, the portable 'yurt' was developed, probably, in its earliest form, around 1000BC. A collapsible wooden structure consisting of supporting 'ribs' that were bent into shape, probably by steam-treating them to give pliancy without breaking, yurts were then covered by layers of hides and wool to keep their occupants both warm and dry. Of course, there was little or no usable wood to be found on the steppes, so the items the nomads had in abundance - hides, wool, cheese and meat - were traded with settled peoples in return for timber to build their homes.	true
technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_improved_processing_techniques	Most ancient world economies were heavily dependent on agriculture; it was the primary means of earning for the common man and the chief means of taxation for the government. Farmers tended to livestock, as well as producing crops of fruits, vegetables, spices and grain. Eventually, agricultural growth due to trade meant the state simply had to become more involved in the day-to-day running of its provinces. New agricultural technology and techniques were taught, and large projects such as dam construction and maintenance took place – paid for with state funds raised through taxation of trade. This, in turn, fed back into agriculture and, eventually, vast profits from trade.	true

technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_3_eastern_church	A good example of patriarchal consecration is the case of Aksum, where conversion to Christianity was, in large part, due to the efforts of Saint Frumentius. He wished for the full conversion of all of Ethiopia, and so journeyed to Alexandria, in Egypt, to request aid in this task. At the time, the Patriarch of Alexandria was part of the Pentarchy - the five major Christian Sees that oversaw the administration of the Church - and he ruled that Frumentius himself was best suited to the task, consecrating him as Bishop in AD328. On his return to Aksum, Frumentius established an episcopal see and, after baptising the Aksumite king, Ezana, began the full conversion of the kingdom to Christianity.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_4_eastern_church	Asceticism is the practice of living as simple a life as possible, rejecting material objects and physical desires with the intention of aiding the pursuit of spiritual understanding. An example of extreme religious devotion, the roots of the practice come from disciplined philosophical and physical training. The word 'asceticism' comes from the Greek word 'askesis', meaning "to train". Ancient Greek athletes practised celibacy to hone their minds and bodies for the physical trials that lay ahead; philosophers trained their minds to resist the lure of physical pleasure. Probably the most famous ascetic was Saint Simeon Stylites, who lived in Aleppo, Syria, atop a pillar for 37 years. He attempted to remove himself thoroughly from the material and physical pleasures of life to achieve a greater spirituality and understanding of God.	true

Investigation into more natural solutions revealed preliminary understanding of atomics, which fed into understanding of the elements. As the Romans conquered their philosophy expanded to become self-aggrandising; Rome conquered, thus Rome was right. Great edifices to their glory, and to the gods, were erected from concrete in impressively short timeframes. Christianity, and the notion of the Emperor's semi-divinity, later bolstered the self-absorbed notion of Roman philosophy and its outlook on the world -  the Emperor was charged with the task of uniting the world, in the name of God!

The power plays of John the Cappadocian - minister of finance at the time - saw that Belisarius and his forces were inadequately supplied for their journey, with the bread provided to the army so ill-prepared that it rotted in its sacks. This supply crisis resulted in the loss of a proportion of Belisarius' men to plague long before battle was joined, a loss which would have been more severe had the general not managed to acquire emergency supplies of bread from the Greek city of Methone.

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_new_agricultural_practices	During late antiquity, Germanic Europe experienced something that could be described as an agricultural revolution. Across central and eastern Europe, the rise of larger rural farming areas heralded an intensification of agriculture and a massive increase in food production. As the chief factor behind population growth is access to food supply, this intensification led to a miniature population explosion which enabled barbarian kings to more easily populate their armies. The increase in food produced also created a surplus that could be used as currency. Armies found themselves furnished with equipment and goods, bought and paid for by the surplus of food. This equipment, however, was also sourced from an increasingly diverse economy, as the barbarians expanded production across Europe. In the mountains of modern-day Poland there is evidence of excavation of iron ore on a massive scale. In addition, at least one source was producing mass-produced, military-grade weaponry for the barbarian forces, and gold and silver jewellery began springing up in eastern Europe as time went on. The diversification of barbarian production furthered their economic gains and made them a greater threat to the wilting Roman Empire.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_1_pagan	The zodiac calendar is a circle divided into the 12 signs, corresponding to the paths of the sun, moon and planets across the "celestial sphere". The word zodiac comes from Greek and means "circle of animals", referring to the beasts assigned to each sign - the bull, the ram, etc. Originally, the calendar was used as an ecliptic co-ordinate system, but became associated with astrology as scholars attempted to divine how the powers of the stars affected the natural world. As such, the zodiac was used to portend dark events or to explain phenomenon like natural catastrophes or rebellions. The Himyar version of this calendar differed as it was arranged in a rectangle, with the animals ascending from left to right (so Sagittarius would be to the right of Scorpio). The animals themselves have remained the same over the years, though their significance and meaning has altered somewhat.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_2_pagan	Religious life in southern Arabia was concerned with the introspective - looking inside oneself and finding religious clarity there. Desert hermits, for instance, spent their lives in isolated eremitic communities praying and contemplating divinity. Pilgrimage was also an important part of the religious life of the region and there are stelae that describe them in minute detail, explaining how many animals should be slaughtered and what should be done in every temple along the way. The pilgrimages also occurred in pre-monotheist Arabia and were often undertaken in the name of Ta'lab Riyam in the hope that he would bestow good fortune upon the pilgrims.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_3_pagan	Nights were long, cold, and dark in the desert. Bringing everyone in a group together around a large fire kept them warm and allowed hot meals to be shared, ensuring everyone got their fair share. This in turn engendered a sense of community, kept most predators at bay, and instilled a feeling of safety amongst the tribe members. In practice, a large fire was constructed in a circle, and everyone sat around it, talking, eating, drinking, and huddling together for warmth and companionship. Of course, communal spaces also served other important purposes. Stories were passed down from generation to generation this way; tribal histories and legends gradually melded together until they became one and the same. A gathering of the entire tribal group also gave its leaders the opportunity to reveal their plans to everyone at once, and deal with any questions or concerns they may have.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_4_pagan	The Mesopotamian pantheon is arguably the oldest religion in the world, and definitely the first to be codified. It was one of the most densely populated, with evidence of more than two thousand gods who watched over every aspect of human life. This vast religion was far-reaching in its influence; even the Arabian tribes, far to the south, worshipped Mesopotamian gods who, although slightly altered in their aspects and purposes, remained essentially the same deities. One such example is Athtar, the Semitic god of war and the morning star. He was worshipped throughout Arabia as Ishtar - also the name of the Mesopotamian goddess of fertility and war. Athtar was worshipped with flames; temples to the god contained an open pit with a fire burning in the centre. This connects Ishtar to Zoroastrianism, which has a concept of holy fire known as 'atar', illustrating just how far the influence of the old gods reaches.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_organised_foreign_policy	In order to cement and legitimise their rule, the western barbarians sought to go further than merely adding a layer of their most prestigious people on top of existing Roman society. The Ostrogothic king, Theoderic the Great, for instance, immediately forged alliances through the marriage of his most loyal free men to the daughters of Roman nobles and those of his barbarian rivals amongst the Vandals, etc. in order that society might quickly return to a sense of normality and community, and life might go on relatively unhindered. There was an ulterior motive, however, in that Theoderic wished barbarian Europe to stand behind him against the Eastern Roman Empire and any attempts they may make to recapture the territory lost following the West's collapse. Unfortunately, his marriage-alliance policy was only partially successful; the Visigoths were soon at war with the Franks and Theoderic's alliance with the Vandals floundered after the death of Thrasamund, a fellow Arian Christian and enemy of Constantinople.	true

He met them at Ad Decimum, intending to use his largely-cavalry army to encircle the Roman forces, cutting off their inland line of retreat (out of sight of the Roman fleet) and destroying them, just as Hannibal did at the Battle of Cannae in 216BC.

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_trade_rights	Whilst those parts of Europe inside the boundaries of the Roman Empire prospered during antiquity, due to the great roads and merchant fleets built to facilitate commerce, northern, Germanic Europe generally languished in relative isolation. This was only made worse by the movement of the Roman capital further east to Constantinople in the 4th century AD, and the great climate change that ravaged the crops and natural wealth of much of northern and eastern Europe during the Migration Period.

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_civil_irrigation_techniques	Agriculture was - and remains - a difficult endeavour. Water is the crucial factor: rivers and flood plains might be good for growing crops, but a flood can wash away good soil instead of renewing the land. In more arid areas, farmers are reliant on canals and qanats for irrigation, and water must be managed carefully. Basic irrigation systems were widespread in the ancient world because they were simple to maintain. Perennial irrigation was rarer, and required longer canal systems, a method of storage, and better maintenance to ensure that silt and salt build-up was kept in check. For example, in sun-scorched Mesopotamia the river system was able to supply water to the surrounding arable land in the dry season through a system of canals, closed off by dykes and sluice gates. Water was stored in reservoirs, either natural or man-made, and then lifted into the irrigation channels. While this was a labour-intensive task, the results of such toil were remarkable and hugely beneficial to harvests in the area.	true

Rather than resist this cultural shift, the eastern kingdoms convinced themselves that Greek ideas were in fact their own, taken from them during Alexander’s campaign in Persia. Their adoption actually marked a return to 'traditional values'.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_agricultual_diversity	Within the Roman Empire, the diversity of climates spanning its vast holdings ranged from Mediterranean warmth to frigid Balkan forestry, and with this came a wide variety of agricultural output. Although wheat was always the primary crop in the ancient world, barley, rye and oats were also popular - especially in more northern, arid locales. Luxury items, such as olives and wine, were the key financial crops and brought in the most money. The diversity of the crops grown was used both internally and externally, sustaining populations as well as being transported, where possible, to trading partners. Crop production on this scale was managed by handing land over to tenants for intensive farming. Since land ownership was the key distinguishing factor between aristocrats and commoners, the right people – good Romans, often veteran soldiers – were awarded land as pensions, that their sons and grandsons might become the landowning class of future generations. Although the practice wasn't officially continued once the barbarian kingdoms took over former Imperial lands, warriors loyal to their king might expect land as a reward for service, even if the accompanying title meant very little compared to its Roman equivalent.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_reformed_coinage	Although the first mints appeared as early as the 7th century BC and spread swiftly around the ancient world, the concept of using coins to define value wasn't adopted by the northern tribes until much later. Prior to the 2nd century BC, bartering and payment-in-kind were widely-used by various tribes and petty kingdoms; the concept of an alternative to treasure that could be accumulated to obtain wealth was alien to the barbarian mindset. Although coins were used by the Celts from that point onwards, the first Germanic ruler to mint in his own name, and bearing his image, was Rechiar, who was king of the Suebi during the 3rd century AD. However, he had other motives aside from the stimulation of the economy, seeing minting, rightly, as a form of propaganda with which to consolidate his powerbase. Once the Vandals and Visigoths occupied former Roman territory they took over much of the ailing Empire's infrastructure, and as such began minting coins from the late 5th century onwards. At first they simply continued to mint 'pseudo-Imperial' coinage such as the 'tremissis' and 'solidus', but eventually reformed the system and produced independent currency using classic designs. Some mints even appropriated Imperial iconography, something that was undoubtedly shocking to their contemporaries but served as a blatant declaration of intent to rule in the Empire's stead.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_illuminated_manuscripts	As the most studied and referenced book in the age, the Bible was dutifully and exquisitely transcribed in Latin by the monastic orders, in a manner befitting the word of God. One of the most famous manuscripts of the era is the Utrecht Psalter, an exquisite and vibrant collection of ink illustrations accompanying each of the Psalms and one of the most well-known and well-preserved examples of illumination. Also known as 'miniature', from the Latin 'minium' (red lead), used for colouring along with other pigments like vermillion. By the time of late antiquity, papyrus had fallen out of use as a writing surface in favour of the more durable and lasting parchment or vellum, which were carefully prepared before being written upon. Vellum, made from calfskin and usually used for higher-quality texts, was soaked in water and lime and left to dry for several days. Afterwards, excess hair was removed and the skin framed and pressed. Finally, the sheet of vellum was rubbed with a flat object to allow ease of writing; the vellum was then fit for purpose.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_economic_development	Land in the desert kingdoms was, ironically, much more fertile in antiquity than now - so much so that their economic output was mostly agricultural. The Aksumites, who kept some of the most detailed records to survive, exported wheat and barley - as indicated on Aksumite coins - as well as salt. Aksum in particular benefitted also from abundant gold mines - making it hugely wealthy - which it used to trade with foreign powers. Most importantly, access to the Nile Valley via the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean beyond, opened up an extremely profitable trade network along the Silk Road. As a result, exotic goods passed through Aksum on their way to Imperial Rome, making the African kingdom a wealthy and powerful trading nation.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_campaign_planning	During late antiquity, there was little attempt by the European powers to stratify and organise their forces in the same way as the Roman army. In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_military_the_military_code	The rugged, eastern terrain, coupled with living in an almost constant state of warfare against one faction or another, meant that desert warriors had to adapt their tactics, and therefore their equipment and training, to meet the challenges they faced. Over time, cavalry became heavier and began to favour the lance over more traditional skirmish weapons, something driven by the increasingly heavy infantry fielded by the Romans; they could resist arrows, javelins and slingshot, but could they withstand the powerful charge of the eastern cataphracts? The Romans were defeated in this way on many occasions, eventually adapting their own forces in a similar way. Gradually, the armies of lesser powers caught up, heralding the advent of the mounted knight – a model of warrior that persisted for well over a thousand years.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_tithes	War has always been an expensive business, but the funds to pay for it all have to be found somewhere. By the 4th century AD barbarian kings could no longer rely on voluntary support to fuel their military campaigns, forcing them to look elsewhere for the finances to raise and support their armies. For many peoples, their most lucrative assets were agricultural, making farms an obvious target for additional taxation in times of need. Both the Alamanni and Tervingi tribes are known to have levied taxes on agricultural production to pay for the support of their armies. This practice continued well into the Middle Ages; known as 'tithes', the taxable sum was a tenth of the whole - whether that be money or goods. Modern taxation theory also has its roots in such early methods.	true
technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_surplus_food_trade	Barbarian Europe experienced a shift during the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, experiencing what could be described as an agricultural revolution. Across central and eastern Europe, the rise of larger rural farming areas heralded an intensification of agriculture and a massive increase in food production. As the chief factor behind population growth is access to food supply, this intensification led to a miniature population explosion which enabled barbarian kings to support their armies. The increase in food produced also created a surplus that could be used as currency. Armies found themselves furnished with equipment and goods, bought and paid for by the surplus of food. This equipment, however, was also sourced from an increasingly diverse economy, as the barbarians expanded production across Europe. In the mountains of modern-day Poland there is evidence of excavation of iron ore on a massive scale. In addition, at least one source was producing mass-produced, military-grade weaponry for the barbarian forces, and gold and silver jewellery began springing up in eastern Europe as time went on. The diversification of barbarian production furthered their economic gains and made them a greater threat to the wilting Roman Empire.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_civil_kings_decrees	Royal charters are tools used by monarchs to create institutions or to confer titles and powers upon individuals (although they are separate from letters of appointment). In a more modern context, they are most commonly employed to establish organisations or to ratify city status. Charlemagne used royal charters, however, to shape Europe according to his pious, Christian vision. One of his most famous proclamations is the 'Charter of Modern Thought', which instructed the leaders of the Frankish Church to begin giving free education to every boy within their dioceses, creating one of the first general educational systems of the post-Roman world. Yet Charlemagne's royal charters (of which we know roughly 200, if not more, were decreed) granted land, revenue and protection, as well as issuing other economic and political commandments.	true

In recent years, many complex, beautiful artefacts that attest to this have been discovered during archaeological excavations. Through the study of their distinctive patterns it has been possible to piece together a timeline of the emergence and expansion of the production methods and technology used. By specialising in a particular skill or craft, a man's worth increased exponentially, and the items he produced became far more valuable than the cost of the materials used. This, in turn, guaranteed a livelihood for many.	true
technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_trade_customs	Trade between China and the eastern kingdoms was extremely important to the Persian, Arabian, and Aksumite economies. There were three main routes along this “Silk Road” from the Far East: the northern route, which passed through Persia to the Levant and was the source of much Sassanid wealth; the southern route, which involved negotiating the Karakoram mountains, through the Hindu Kush and into Baktria before heading west; the southwestern route, which went down through India before switching to ships (in order to avoid the scorching, inhospitable Arabian desert), sailing around the Horn of Africa and up into the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. This meant that even places such as Himyar and Aksum gained access to Chinese goods, and led to the exchange of cultural ideas and religious beliefs between China, African and Arabia – Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and Buddhism all spread across the Eurasian world in this manner. Of course, it was imperative that the route itself remain open as long as possible, so much effort was expended to keep it free of banditry and ensure that travellers along it were able to get fresh provisions, somewhere to stay, and most of all remained alive for the duration of their highly lucrative journeys.	true

This often led to infighting and, in the case of the Visigoths, civil war. It wasn’t until Euric became king that he was able to defeat many of the powerful chieftains and unite them under one leader. With this new found power, Euric expanded the bounds of his territory into Hispania; by the time of the Western Roman Empire's collapse he had taken control of most of the Iberian Peninsula, all except Galatia. On his death the Visigoths also controlled around a third of Gaul, although they eventually lost all their holdings in the south of the country due to the relentless expansion of the neighbouring Frankish Empire.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_serfdom	Serfdom in the traditional sense did not take hold in the barbarian cultures of Europe; instead, a more traditional form of slavery was common. Slavery differed from serfdom in several ways - serfs worked for their masters but also for themselves, to live, and were generally family units with a degree of independence, however nominal. Slaves, by contrast, had a much more tenuous grasp on the notion of familiarity and freedom, and could also be moved at a moment's notice, sold as part of the booming slave trade, and threatened and mistreated in order to ensure obedience. Slavery was a highly lucrative business in the Middle Ages - both the Byzantine and Islamic empires had much need of free labour and many of the barbarian peoples took slaves simply because they could; weaker peoples were considered exploitable and expendable with it. For instance, the Vikings were prolific slave-owners - they called their captives 'thralls', meaning 'someone in bondage'. Thralls were generally the defeated survivors of war - victims of the Viking's extensive raids across northern Europe and the British Isles. They formed the lowest layer of the three-tiered Viking society, beneath freemen and noblemen. As well as being made to work for their masters, thralls were also sold on to rich powers, such as the Byzantines, for a huge profit.	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_specialised_industry	The fringes of the Roman Empire were home to some of the more specialist industries. Whereas in the Imperial heartlands industry gradually became a mass-produced system of fabricae and latifundia - urban life dictating the demand for cheap, mass-produced items be high - provinces like Britannia and Egypt maintained their own specialised industries. In Egypt, the best-documented of all the Imperial provinces, the production of high-quality textiles was its speciality. The items were produced to a high-standard using traditional techniques and materials, and exported around the known world. Likewise, in Britannia, excavation continues to unearth unusually large quantities of high-quality pottery, indicating that its production was a speciality of the region.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_carolingian_churches	Under the Merovingian dynasty, the Franks pioneered what is now known as the Pre-Romanesque style of architecture and art, which attempted to collate Christian and Mediterranean styles of architecture into a new type of design. Most of the architectural efforts of the Pre-Romanesque period are exemplified by churches and basilicas, whose numbers increased dramatically during the Merovingian period. The monastery at Lorsch, Germany, is a good example of this style, with a stout, steep-roofed gatehouse and arched facade and columns. The gatehouse's triple-arched entrance is an evolution of Pre-Romanesque styles adopted by the later Carolingians as they added Roman features to the existing architectural model. This is also evidenced by the original Palatine Chapel at Charlemagne's Palace of Aachen. Although the original chapel no longer exists, it was reconstructed according to original designs, with an octagonal dome at the centre, over the cloister-vault. Charlemagne's body was interred at the chapel, but unfortunately his body was moved more than once during Medieval times and its location is no longer known.	true

Therefore Belisarius sent his advisor Procopius ahead to gather information. In Syracuse, he learned that the overconfident Vandal king, Gelimer, had sent the fleet away from Carthage and had also vacated the city himself. On relaying this to Belisarius, the plan became clear - the Romans would launch a decisive assault on Carthage to bring a swift end to the conflict. 	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_new_aristocracy	As many former ‘barbarian’ peoples had been brought under Rome’s yolk during the Republican and early Imperial years, Germanic soldiers had served directly in the Roman army for several centuries. Over time, many rose to be Senators and high-ranking administrators such as Magister Militum – a position which was held by several men of barbarian descent over the years. By the 4th and 5th centuries AD, the only way of distinguishing between these ‘Romanitas’ and those of ‘true blood’ was their names, indicating that they had become fully integrated into Roman society in almost every way. The net result of this was the ‘Romanisation’ of many Germanic leaders, which in turn led to a great degree of Romanisation of the barbarian kingdoms that succeeded the collapsed Western Empire from AD476. In order to cement and legitimise their rule, the barbarian successor kings sought to go further than merely adding a layer of their most prestigious people on top of existing Roman society. The Ostrogothic king, Theoderic the Great, for instance, immediately forged alliances through the marriage of his most loyal free men to the daughters of Roman nobles and those of his barbarian rivals amongst the Vandals, etc. in order that society might quickly return to a sense of normality and community, and life might go on relatively unhindered. There was an ulterior motive, however, in that Theoderic wished barbarian Europe to stand behind him against the Eastern Roman Empire and any attempts to recapture the territory lost following the West's collapse. Unfortunately, his marriage-alliance policy was only partially successful; the Visigoths were soon at war with the Franks and Theoderic's alliance with the Vandals floundered after the death of Thrasamund, a fellow Arian Christian and enemy of Constantinople.	true

The 'Witan', as the members were known, were likely advising English rulers for centuries before we have evidence of it, but the first recorded legal codes produced by them date to around AD600 and the reign of Aethelberht of Kent. Witenagemots may have developed out of the 'folkmoots' of Germanic tribes, where communities gathered to discuss matters of governance. Though issues of national significance would be discussed, the council would advise on a local level also.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_divine_sanction	Administrative and economic reform was difficult in the early days of the Sassanid empire, as the powerful noble dynasties, vying for personal power, created too much pressure to allow stable long-term reforms to take place and causing the economy to stagnate. The revolt of Mazdak, however, shattered the socio-economic system and entirely crushed the power of the nobility. Seizing the chance, the Shahanshah immediately put down the rebellion and took control, now free of the nobles’ stranglehold. He implemented sweeping reforms, creating a system of administrative districts and laws, and systemised taxes and imposts in the way the House of Sassan had envisioned. Over time, other eastern kingdoms took their lead from the Persian example, reducing the risk of insurrection by adding checks and balances to their internal systems, chiefly through the appointment of government officials whose job it was to ensure the king’s wishes were carried out to the letter.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_warlords_power	Many nobles began as friends and battle companions of the king, but as time passed and kingdoms grew large, they became the rulers of the land they held in trust for their lord. Gifted land and titles for continued service, they were expected to manage the king's provinces and summon men to war when needed. During the Saxon Wars of AD772-804, the Saxon king Widukind, in his attempt to defeat Charlemagne and frustrate his desire to convert the Saxons to Christianity, was able to incense his nobles to stand behind him against this fiercely Christian threat from the west. Alongside an alliance with the Frisians, Widukind granted many of his warriors autonomous control of their regions in order to incentivise them to drive back the Carolingians.	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_codification_of_laws	In AD429, Theodosius II and his co-Emperor, Valentinian III, enacted a commission to unify classical Roman law with their more modern Imperial legislature. The 'Codex Theodosianus', as it was known, took 22 experts nine years to pull together across sixteen volumes, and represented the majority of Rome's legal framework, codified for first time since the foundation of the 'Twelve Tables'. It was not without problems, however. The Codex was hard to properly research, with laws changing even as they were being written. Delays in acquiring information from Rome, Ravenna and private collections made editing it a frustrating process. Nevertheless, the Codex represented a major breakthrough in the documentation of Roman legal processes. It also increased state authority on religious matters, expanding on Christianity's decriminalisation under Constantine and solidly positioning it as Rome's official state religion; one that was intrinsically linked to the role of Emperor.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_siege_stores	Sieges in the Dark and early Middle Ages were varied affairs - they either ended in a short, bloody battle, or settled into protracted situations of more devious strategies and classic blockade warfare. For the defenders, they were often secure in the knowledge that an enemy assault on the walls would be easy for them to repel. On the other hand, attackers knew that starving out the defenders may take time but would likely result in ultimate victory. However, it was only after increased contact with the enemy that they truly learned. Roman siege techniques, and the technology that went with them, took hold elsewhere as the art of urban warfare developed. Many powers kept secret supply networks and vast stores of food in preparation for drawn-out assaults. Much of this went unnoticed, allowing their armies to outlast the enemy on each occasion. 	true
technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_weapon_mastery	The Migration Period saw significant changes in the types of weapons favoured by the barbarian tribes. Due to the nefarious influence of the steppe peoples, bows became far more widely used. This included the adoption of the nomadic arrow; larger than others of the time and with three flights, it became the arrow of choice across the western world, as evidenced by grave-finds all over Europe. Around this time, single-edged weapons from the east also appeared - such as the longsword and the seax - examples of which have been discovered inside the tombs of high-ranking barbarians in Altlussheim, Tournai and Pouan.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_serfdom	Serfdom in the traditional sense did not take hold in the barbarian cultures of Europe; instead, a more traditional form of slavery was common. Slavery differed from serfdom in several ways - serfs worked for their masters but also for themselves, to live, and were generally family units with a degree of independence, however nominal. Slaves, by contrast, had a much more tenuous grasp on the notion of familiarity and freedom, and could also be moved at a moment's notice, sold as part of the booming slave trade, and threatened and mistreated in order to ensure obedience. Slavery was a highly lucrative business in the Middle Ages - both the Byzantine and Islamic empires had much need of free labour and many of the barbarian peoples took slaves simply because they could; weaker peoples were considered exploitable and expendable with it. For instance, the Vikings were prolific slave-owners - they called their captives 'thralls', meaning 'someone in bondage'. Thralls were generally the defeated survivors of war - victims of the Viking's extensive raids across northern Europe and the British Isles. They formed the lowest layer of the three-tiered Viking society, beneath freemen and noblemen. As well as being made to work for their masters, thralls were also sold on to rich powers, such as the Byzantines, for a huge profit.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_civil_trade_rights	Whilst those parts of Europe inside the boundaries of the Roman Empire prospered during antiquity, due to the great roads and merchant fleets built to facilitate commerce, northern, Germanic Europe generally languished in relative isolation. This was only made worse by the movement of the Roman capital further east to Constantinople in the 4th century AD, and the great climate change that ravaged the crops and natural wealth of much of northern and eastern Europe during the Migration Period. By the 7th century AD, however, the Merovingian Frankish kings began revitalising trade in northern Europe with a fair at St. Denis, which connected cities across the northern continent, mainly via old Roman roads and the network of rivers that lattice Europe. As the climate change abated, ports and river villages began to become important trade hubs once again, and none more so than the city of Dorestad. Ideally positioned between the Franks and the Frisians, it allowed merchants a convenient half-way point to meet and do business. Its value, however, dragged it into a battle for power between the two, a conflict that widened as the Middle Ages progressed, ultimately leading to the downfall of Dorestad as a major trading city.	true

technologies_long_description_att_slav_civil_payment_in_gold_venedi	The system of 'foederati' originally made the Roman Empire powerful, aiding in their subjugation of barbarian tribes. However, as time went on, it helped to cripple them as they were forced tor rely more and more on barbarian federate forces to fight their wars for them. Proximity to the Empire often meant that it was simply a matter of time before a people came into their sphere of influence, and so it was with the Slavs. The Anteans, close to Eastern Roman borders, were offered foederati status in exchange for gold and military service - a bulwark against the marauding steppe nomads. As a result, the Romans gifted the Anteans a fort on the strategically important Danube river. They were also expected to take part in Rome's wars, which they continued to do until destroyed and assimilated by the Avars in the 7th century AD.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_civil_water_power	Before the advent of industrial mechanisation and electric power, harnessing the power of flowing water was the most effective method of generating energy for industry and agriculture. Water wheels and mills were known to have been used throughout ancient Rome and India, whereby the flow of a river (or, in Medieval times, the tide) turns gears and belts to generate power for irrigation. A process known as 'hushing' was developed during the 1st century AD and had been widely adopted by the dawn of the Middle Ages. Hushing is the deliberate and targeted use of torrents of water to wash away layers of soil and debris around seams so that they could be mined, with a sluice gate opened to control the strength of the water flow. In an era before explosives, hushing was an excellent method of revealing the minerals and wealth of the earth - and is still used to some extent in cases where explosives are deemed too destructive to the area being mined.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_military_long_marches	During late antiquity, there was little attempt by the European powers to stratify and organise their forces in the same way as the Roman army. In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_involuntary_levy	In the ancient world, it was sometimes deemed necessary to supplement trained forces with a levy of largely untrained men, usually to pin down or distract the enemy sufficiently for the professional troops to outflank them. In times of need, levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army whether citizens or subjects. Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, they supplemented the elite professional soldiers. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_martial_culture_vandal	Battle was an integral part of the various barbarian cultures of antiquity. Tribes of all ethnicities fought the neighbouring Celts, Germans, Slavs, Norsemen, Greeks, nomads and, above all others, the expansionist, imperialist Romans. Amongst themselves, tribes fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class or two nominated champions facing off in single combat. For the would-be warrior, displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids once they had reached manhood. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true

Simple synaxaria are basic lists or beatified people, but others contain full historical and biographical accounts of their lives and deeds, and as such are important sources of the local history of the time. In Christianity, the definition of synaxaria changed over time so that they became the Gospel and Apostolic catalogues.

technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_2_eastern_church_lakhmid	The Apostolic Constitutions are a series of eight treatises acting as instructions for the Christian clergy (and to a lesser extent for the laity). Although their true authorship remains unknown, the Constitutions are alleged to have been written by the Twelve Apostles of Jesus.

technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_3_eastern_church_lakhmid	A good example of patriarchal consecration is the case of Aksum, where conversion to Christianity was, in large part, due to the efforts of Saint Frumentius. He wished for the full conversion of all of Ethiopia, and so journeyed to Alexandria, in Egypt, to request aid in this task. At the time, the Patriarch of Alexandria was part of the Pentarchy - the five major Christian Sees that oversaw the administration of the Church - and he ruled that Frumentius himself was best suited to the task, consecrating him as Bishop in AD328. On his return to Aksum, Frumentius established an episcopal see and, after baptising the Aksumite king, Ezana, began the full conversion of the kingdom to Christianity.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_4_eastern_church_lakhmid	Asceticism is the practice of living as simple a life as possible, rejecting material objects and physical desires with the intention of aiding the pursuit of spiritual understanding. An example of extreme religious devotion, the roots of the practice come from disciplined philosophical and physical training. The word 'asceticism' comes from the Greek word 'askesis', meaning "to train". Ancient Greek athletes practised celibacy to hone their minds and bodies for the physical trials that lay ahead; philosophers trained their minds to resist the lure of physical pleasure. Probably the most famous ascetic was Saint Simeon Stylites, who lived in Aleppo, Syria, atop a pillar for 37 years. He attempted to remove himself thoroughly from the material and physical pleasures of life to achieve a greater spirituality and understanding of God.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_carolingian_renaissance	Charlemagne's almost overpowering desire to enact reform across his lands, and indeed all of Europe, ushered in what is now known as the Carolingian Renaissance. During this time, the king's efforts saw an increased focus on education, religion, architecture and the arts. All this was driven by Charlemagne's desire to repair the moral fabric of his society, the thinking being that better education and leadership from the Church would give rise to a widespread increase in writing and literacy amongst the population. The renaissance also saw architectural styles developed, inspired by the Franks' Roman and Mediterranean forebears, as more and more churches were built across the kingdom at Charlemagne's behest. These new chapels and basilicas were bursting with the emergent styles of illuminated art and manuscripts, bringing life and vibrancy to the church and to society in general.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_civil_court_school	Following the collapse of the Roman system along with its Western Empire, the Church gradually established cathedral schools. They were intended as centres of literary, religious and civil learning, as opposed to simply teaching nobles the ways of war. For example, Charlemagne was determined to reform the Frankish Kingdom's educational system in favour of broader educational institutions, so that a greater proportion of his subjects could be educated. He did this by inviting Alcuin, a scholar from York, to his court at Aachen, along with Peter of Pisa and others. Alcuin became Charlemagne's 'prime minister of education' and held sway in all scholastic matters for the entire realm, as well as personally tutoring the king. Later, Charlemagne decreed the 'Charter of Modern Thought', with the view that every boy should be given a basic education, not just the sons of the noble elite.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_defencive_logistics	An army can live off the land in most places. What can’t be found, stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried with it: arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load, medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable as opposed to just plain miserable. Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or exhausted. He will not give his best in such circumstances, no matter how inspiring the leadership qualities of his commanders.	true

Although surgery did not take hold for many  centuries to come, the techniques discussed and pioneered during the early Middle Ages were used to help bandage up soldiers so they could continue fighting. Rudimentary approaches to amputation, also, were used to remove mangled or infected limbs, although the victim's chances of survival were extremely slim. The surgeon was in the business of patching up warriors; later, if wounds became infected and resulted in death, that was simply none of his concern.	true

Although they formed the backbone of many local garrisons, eastern soldiers were a minority in Cordoban forces, with north African Berber and local Andalusian troops making up the majority. These native men were trained by the Muslims, attaining status within the new society at the same time. Utilising the population in this way had the double effect of fulfilling the Emirate's military needs whilst also exerting local influence, preventing any would-be rebels from entertaining seditious thoughts. The thinking was that those who had an active part within the state could discuss the dissenters' issues in terms they would understand, resolving problems and smoothing the path for the country's new rulers. Additionally, of course, those who wished to maintain their relatively privileged positions may also be more inclined to act in the Emirate's best interests.	true

Each court was represented by seven scabini, who were, in essence, legal encyclopaedias, theoretically possessing all there was to know about Frankish and Salic law between them. These men were held in particularly high esteem and reported directly to the judge or, in many cases, passed judgement themselves based on their understanding of legal precedents. Carolingian law also forbade judges, in a bizarrely obvious move, from accepting bribes and told them to make decisions based solely on evidence and inquest. They were also to keep with them at all times a copy of the 'Lex Ripuara' -  a collection of Germanic law and the basis and inspiration for the later 'Lex Salica'.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_civil_shire	The division of British territory into what we now call counties most likely started with the Romans, who divided the country into regions according to natural features such as rivers or mountains. It was the kingdom of Wessex, in the south of England, that first subdivided its lands further, into shires and boroughs - a style that soon caught on as Mercia ascended to a position of influence over the other Anglo-Saxons. The Mercians charged ealdormen (the root of the more contemporary 'earl') with the governance of shires. Although the word has fallen out of use in favour of counties, their influence can still be found in county names such as Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Lancashire.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_warrior_aristocracy	If the collapse of the Roman Empire made one thing clear, it was that life would never – could never – be the same as it had been for centuries prior. The barbarian kingdoms that swept away Rome's remnants assumed much of its workable infrastructure, particularly that relating to the organisation of the armed forces. Of course, this also gave them a means of controlling the young, educated class who might otherwise fight against the new regimes; by offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, their loyalty could be secured. The kingdoms of the late Dark and early Middle Ages were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to be aspired to. Members were obligated to fight for the king, and provide troops from their own retinues, whenever he called them to do so. In return, they were given lands and titles under the proviso they enforced the king's laws and offered protection to the peasants who worked them. In real terms, this was a license to behave in almost any way they liked - the vassals had the weapons and the training to make any point they so chose; the serfs, on the other hand, had none of those things, and therefore no chance to rise up and change their situation. 	true

technologies_long_description_att_slav_civil_elite_dominance_antes	'Elite Theory' is a sociological paradigm that exists as strongly today as in antiquity. By its most basic definition, the theory proposes that the powerful and the wealthy - the 'elite' - form a ruling minority in society, responsible for all the decision-making within their social structure. In contemporary society, these are generally issues of economic and political direction, but during antiquity this dominance would have had much greater influence – which gods were worshipped, for instance, all the way down to how people spoke and which words were used. The culture of entire tribes, as well as their linguistic development, could be altered by a relative minority. For instance, if a ruling elite used a different language to the 'lesser' majority, it is conceivable that their cultural and linguistic preferences would be imprinted upon the rest of the population, forcing a slow but gradual shift in their societal development.	true
technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_land_tenancy	Within the Roman Empire, the diversity of climates spanning its vast holdings ranged from Mediterranean warmth to frigid Balkan forestry, and with this came a wide variety of agricultural output. Although wheat was always the primary crop in the ancient world, barley, rye and oats were also popular - especially in more northern, arid locales. Luxury items, such as olives and wine, were the key financial crops and brought in the most money. The diversity of the crops grown was used both internally and externally, sustaining populations as well as being transported, where possible, to trading partners. Crop production on this scale was managed by handing land over to tenants for intensive farming. Since land ownership was the key distinguishing factor between aristocrats and commoners, the right people – good Romans, often veteran soldiers – were awarded land as pensions, that their sons and grandsons might become the landowning class of future generations. Although the practice wasn't officially continued once the barbarian kingdoms took over former Imperial lands, warriors loyal to their king might expect land as a reward for service, even if the accompanying title meant very little compared to its Roman equivalent.	true

technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_1_judaism_himyar	Jewish law does not stop at the religious ceremony. Judaism prescribes rules and enforceable civil and religious laws, with instructions on how to live every aspect of daily life, from waking up in the morning to sleeping in the evening. These laws were collated into a body known as Halakha. These laws claim to preserve the oral Jewish traditions that originated on Mount Sinai and include the 613 'mitzvot', or commandments, known also as the 'Laws of Moses'. The mitzvot are separated into 248 positive commandments and 365 negative commandments - the positive are activities to be undertaken, the negative abstained from at all times. In modern Judaism, the Halakha is much less relevant - modern Reform Judaism placing less importance on them. Orthodox and Conservative Judaism, however, still see the Halakha as fully binding, divine laws.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_2_judaism_himyar	Food that is 'kosher' meets the criteria of 'kashrut'; Jewish dietary laws. It comes from the Hebrew 'kashér', meaning 'fit' - so kosher means food that is fit to consume. Kashrut details the types of food that are deemed not kosher in a numerous, expansive list drawn from Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Some of the more obscure laws of kashrut forbid the consumption of fruit from a tree not yet three years old, and every type of invertebrate animal. Most well-known is the pig, who is deemed by kashrut to be unclean for having cloven hooves but not chewing the cud. There is much scholarly debate as to why kosher laws exist, with some suggestions that they are concerned with the hygiene considerations of the time, whilst others say non-kosher and non-kosher foods represent religious virtues and vices. 	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_3_judaism_himyar	A common practice in Judaism is that of 'ablution' - or ritual purification. A feature of many ancient religions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Shinto, it was believed important to rid oneself of "ritual impurity" before performing certain acts. The procedures of ritual washing are described in rabbinic literature following the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem, and are less extensive than the rituals of the Temple era. Many acts of purification do not require anything more than a washing of the hands, such as before and after meals, or after touching certain parts of the body. Other acts required full immersion in a mikveh (a bath drawn from a natural source); sex, skin conditions and contact with corpses, for instance, require full immersion as part of the ablutions - surely a hygienic consideration as much as a religious one.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_4_judaism_himyar	In the absence of a king from David's line, the Sanhedrin - assemblies of elected men from across Israel - ordained sages as 'rabbis' - teachers - to give them judicial power. Rabbis came to prominence during the 2nd century AD, when they codified the beliefs and tenets of the faith due to a fear of losing Jewish oral traditions in the wake of Second Temple's destruction and the dissolution of the Sanhedrin amidst increased Roman persecution. The Sanhedrin were part of the Palestinian Patriarchy, or 'Rabbinic' Patriarchy, scholars from the various Talmudic academies who were considered the authority on religious and legal matters across Judaism, and given far-reaching judicial powers. The Patriarchy's chief achievement was the creation of the Mishnah, the first significant revision to the Oral Torah.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_slavic_martial_culture_venedi	Battle was an integral part of the various barbarian cultures of antiquity. Tribes of all ethnicities fought the neighbouring Celts, Germans, Slavs, Norsemen, Greeks, nomads and, above all others, the expansionist, imperialist Romans. Amongst themselves, tribes fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class or two nominated champions facing off in single combat. For the would-be warrior, displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids once they had reached manhood. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_civil_horse_racing	A source of food, a symbol of wealth, a beast of burden and a tool of war, the horse was one of the most versatile commodities in the ancient world. Equus ferus’ role was tied to its physical form – the small, early horse could only be used to pull primitive chariots. Larger, faster horses were later bred and used by skirmishers to chase down troops, but it was not until the development of more muscular breeds that shock troops such as the cataphracts came into being. Their long lances and heavy armour made these new-style heavy cavalry units deadly against infantry, fundamentally changing the nature of warfare forever. The racing of horses for sport went hand in hand with their military use, and of course provided useful training for both rider and animal.	true

Goths, Sarmatians and Greeks all passed through what is now the Ukraine, and mingled with the Slavic culture found there. In many of these circumstances, the indigenous Slavs assimilated the foreign cultures into their own - the Thracians, for instance, vanished as a unique entity and were absorbed wholly into the Slavic collective. However, it was not always the case that the Slavs dominated culturally - when some tribes migrated into densely populated Greek territory, the Slavs found themselves Hellenised instead.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_religious_intolerance	As late antiquity progressed, most of the desert kingdoms abandoned their polytheistic past and embraced the monotheism of Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Judaism. With this newfound religious fervour so too came religious intolerance and persecution. The Himyarite Kingdom, in particular, was renowned for its persecution of Christians. Its society had been militaristic for hundreds of years, and was almost constantly at war with Aksum during that time; the Himyarite conversion to Judaism was, in many ways, just another reason to legitimise this ceaseless conflict with their Christian enemies. Their widespread, violent intolerance was the cause of much bloodshed over the years; the Aksumite invasion and subsequent destruction of Himyar in AD520 was a direct response to Christian deaths at Himyarite hands.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_conquerors	The early Middle Ages was a time defined by fledgling European nations, attempting to find purchase in a world still trying to drag itself out of the chaos of the Dark Ages. The Lombards, Saxons and Avars wanted to make a safe home for their people, yet the Franks under Charlemagne were dogmatic about expanding and spreading their culture and religion across the world. Charlemagne, though a conqueror, was unusually (for the time) concerned with the welfare and wellbeing of his subjects, enacting sweeping educational, administrative and religious reform aimed at educating and healing local communities. He extended this policy to his conquered territories, as long as they abandoned paganism and embraced Christianity as their faith. Broadly the same policy was enacted by the Umayyad Caliphate, although they were notably far more tolerant of other faiths amongst their conquered peoples than Charlemagne. As a counterpoint to this, the Viking excursions and raids across the northern European shores and the British Isles were concerned not with the sentiments of the local populace, but only with the personal gain and glory of the Vikings. They, too, were looking for a place to settle and call home, but they cared little for the people they displaced in order to do so.	true

In this way, the priesthood grew to wield influence over military and judicial matters as well. By the same token, the king was able to do whatever he wanted as long as he had “divine sanction” – the official approval of Ahura Mazda through his priesthood.	true

Every aspect of society felt the strain of waging conquest or defending against invaders. Men from the Sassanid Empire were drafted from the peasantry to fight, and most likely die, for their lord when the king called them to war. Those not called to fight had their work and produce requisitioned, particularly during last-minute preparations, such as the defence of a city. 	true

technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_civil_celebrated_philosophy	The eastern nations are renowned as centres of learning and enlightenment, creating some of the earliest universities. Although institutions such as the Platonic Academy existed in Greece hundreds of years before, these new centres of learning were more philosophical clubs than schools per se. For instance, the Sassanid Academy of Gondishapur and the Persian School of Nisibis, as well as the Pandidakterion in Constantinople, are widely regarded as the world's first universities. Gondishapur became such a centre of medical learning that many scholars credit it as the birthplace of the modern hospital system. The 'House of Wisdom', also, established in the late 8th century AD in Baghdad, became a repository of knowledge and progressive thinking, and as such attracted many scholars and intellectuals to creating a melting pot of ideologies. As a result, the House of Wisdom became, by the ebbing of the 10th century, the largest library in the world.	true

They were expected to fire as fast and as accurately as possible, creating a screen of missiles that softened the enemy up for the Savaran charge.

Although surgery did not take hold for many  centuries to come, the techniques discussed and pioneered during the early Middle Ages were used to help bandage up soldiers so they could continue fighting. Rudimentary approaches to amputation, also, were used to remove mangled or infected limbs, although the victim's chances of survival were extremely slim. The surgeon was in the business of patching up warriors; later, if wounds became infected and resulted in death, that was simply none of his concern.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_west_civil_local_trade_venues	The Eastern Roman Empire, at its peak, covered roughly 1.3 million square kilometres. The diversity of climates spanning the vast Imperial holdings ranged from Mediterranean warmth to frigid Balkan forestry, and with this came a wide variety of agricultural output. Wheat was the primary crop, being grown across the majority of the Empire, but also barley, rye and oats - especially in more northern, arid locales. Luxury items, such as olives and wine, were the key financial crops and brought in the most money. The discovery of numerous, tiny pockets of soil in the Syrian massif regions is indicative of a specialised industry there, dedicated to the cultivation and production of olives, much like the specialist vineyards scattered across the Empire. The diversity of the crops grown was used both internally and externally, sustaining both Rome and her people as well as being transported, when possible, to trading partners. As well as Empire-wide and international distribution, evidence suggests that the Near East was also a hub for prosperous local trade; the discovery of coins and pottery across the area attest to this, as does the economic survival of the region far beyond that of more distant Imperial acquisitions, such as Britannia.	true

Whilst their battle tactics were proven, their longbows, often two metres in length and made of yew, lacked the power and accuracy of composite bows made in the east. Their ammunition was also somewhat lacking: limited iron supplies meant these men often fired bone-tipped arrows that struggled to pierce enemy armour.

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_trade_rights	Whilst those parts of Europe inside the boundaries of the Roman Empire prospered during antiquity, due to the great roads and merchant fleets built to facilitate commerce, northern, Germanic Europe generally languished in relative isolation. This was only made worse by the movement of the Roman capital further east to Constantinople in the 4th century AD, and the great climate change that ravaged the crops and natural wealth of much of northern and eastern Europe during the Migration Period. By the 7th century AD, however, the Merovingian Frankish kings began revitalising trade in northern Europe with a fair at St. Denis, which connected cities across the northern continent, mainly via old Roman roads and the network of rivers that lattice Europe. As the climate change abated, ports and river villages began to become important trade hubs once again, and none more so than the city of Dorestad. Ideally positioned between the Franks and the Frisians, it allowed merchants a convenient half-way point to meet and do business. Its value, however, dragged it into a battle for power between the two, a conflict that widened as the Middle Ages progressed, ultimately leading to the downfall of Dorestad as a major trading city.	true

This time, however, Justinian named him 'Strategos Autokrator' (contemporarily, 'Commander-in-Chief'). This, at least theoretically, gave him total authority over the military expedition into the old Roman heartland. The title was Greek, where it had long been awarded to generals who were vested with independent authority - Philip II of Macedon, for instance, was Strategos Autokrator for the southern Greek states, as indeed was his son - the future Alexander the Great.	true

One of the most famous manuscripts of the era is the Utrecht Psalter, an exquisite and vibrant collection of ink illustrations accompanying each of the Psalms and one of the most well-known and well-preserved examples of illumination. Also known as 'miniature', from the Latin 'minium' (red lead), used for colouring along with other pigments like vermillion. By the time of late antiquity, papyrus had fallen out of use as a writing surface in favour of the more durable and lasting parchment or vellum, which were carefully prepared before being written upon. Vellum, made from calfskin and usually used for higher-quality texts, was soaked in water and lime and left to dry for several days. Afterwards, excess hair was removed and the skin framed and pressed. Finally, the sheet of vellum was rubbed with a flat object to allow ease of writing; the vellum was then fit for purpose.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_aprisio	In order to cement and legitimise their rule, the former 'barbarian' kingdoms sought to go further than merely adding a layer of their most prestigious people on top of the old Roman societal infrastructure. Alliances were forged and loyalty secured through intermarriage between ruling houses, a practice which continued right up to the modern age. Another way of maintaining stability was to 'buy' allegiances via the gifting of strategically-positioned territories, thus ensuring that potential rivals were placated and, rather more cynically, so 'buffer' states existed between the giver and any hostile powers. Initially all this was designed in order to present a united front against the Byzantine Romans – who would surely come to reclaim their former Empire in the west – but eventually was just a way of keeping the emergent royal houses in control of their kingdoms.	true
technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_perennial_agriculture	Basic irrigation systems were widespread in the ancient world because they were simple to maintain. Perennial irrigation was rarer, and required longer canal systems, a method of storage, and better maintenance to ensure that silt and salt build-up was kept in check. In Mesopotamia, the river system was able to supply water to the surrounding arable land in the dry season through a system of canals, closed off by dykes and sluice gates. Water was stored in reservoirs, either natural or man-made, and then lifted into the irrigation channels. While this was a labour-intensive task, the results of such toil were remarkable and hugely beneficial to harvests in the area.	true

Its dramatic increase during the late period of the Western Empire, however, was indicative of a desire within the west to incorporate more and more of the defeated to help drive Rome's military and economic state. These resettled peoples were called tributarii and were often given fertile lands to work, as well as having to pay taxes.

Historians currently believe that this was not the norm within tribal society; intricate and richly decorated weapons were reserved for the elite and may never have been used in war, as few bare the marks of being used in battle. How then were the men of the tribe armed and armoured? There is evidence to suggest that by AD300 some barbarian peoples had adopted the Roman method of supplying standardised weapons to their armies, produced in specific factories known as fabricae. 	true

This often led to infighting and, in the case of the Visigoths, civil war. It wasn’t until Euric became king that he was able to defeat many of the powerful chieftains and unite them under one leader. With this new found power, Euric expanded the bounds of his territory into Hispania; by the time of the Western Roman Empire's collapse he had taken control of most of the Iberian Peninsula, all except Galatia. On his death the Visigoths also controlled around a third of Gaul, although they eventually lost all their holdings in the south of the country due to the relentless expansion of the neighbouring Frankish Empire.	true

However, this practice was not limited to the Romans; barbarian tribes often sought assistance from their neighbours in times of need. When the Goths became trapped in the northern Balkans in AD377 they recruited Huns and Alans to remove the Roman garrison that was blocking the passes of the Haemus Mons range. In return for saving the Goths from certain starvation, the steppe mercenaries were promised their fair share of plunder, an arrangement that pleased all involved, except for the Romans of course!	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_dam_improvemetns_and_repairs	All crops need irrigation. In the vast, arid climes of the Arabian peninsula and surrounding areas, this is especially true. The construction of dams for irrigation goes back many thousands of years, some of the oldest being the masonry-faced dam at Jawa, in Jordan, and the Ma'rib Dam in Yemen. Despite the impressive nature of their engineering, early dams had problems stemming from the construction methods used. Perhaps most famously, the Ma'rib Dam suffered a dramatic collapse owing to a lack of maintenance. Built by the Sabaeans, the original dam was an earthen construction; packed earth built to stem the flow of the monsoon seasons, with an outer layer of rocks to resist erosion. The Himyarites improved upon this design, raising the walls of the dam higher and reconstructing them from solid stone. They also added impressive hydraulic systems and added sluice gates (the only part of the dam that remains today). It was plagued, however, by a build-up of silt that caused the water to flood when rainfall was heavy, and the repairs - the repeated raising of the dam wall - became more expensive and difficult to achieve. In AD575 it spilled over for the final time and was never repaired due to the collapse of the Himyarite Kingdom and its government; the disaster had a devastating effect on local crops and led the population to migrate to other, more fertile areas.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_solidus	Charlemagne made his mark on Europe in almost every way. Shortly after assuming power, he struck his kingdom's currency, the 'livre', for the first time. A livre could be broken down into twenty 'sous' (known in the old Roman Empire as 'solidus'), which in turn consisted of twelve 'deniers' or silver pennies. The gold solidus, however, was a paper accounting unit only (that is, not physically minted, simply used for division), as the Franks adopted the silver standard and the livre itself was equal in weight to a pound of silver. The system was supposed to be standardised throughout the kingdom but a coin's value frequently differed depending on where it was minted. Despite this, the 'Livre Carolingienne', as it was known, and in particular the denier, became the basis of European currency for year to come, up to the modern age in fact, including influencing the development of the English pound and penny.	true

technologies_long_description_att_celtic_military_celtic_carpentry	The ancient shipbuilding tradition of the Norse raiders produced many enduring designs. Over time, their frequent attacks on both the Scottish and Irish coasts meant that Celtic forces occasionally captured Nordic vessels, and studied their construction in depth. Variously, this tradition produced ‘long fhada’ – literally ‘long ships’ in Gaelic – such as the ‘birlinn’ and ‘Irish galley’. Both types of vessel had between eight and twelve oars, in addition to a large sail. These features that allowed the new ships to either hug coastlines or cross the open sea when war or trade dictated. Copying the longship’s shallow draft and double-ended design, the long fhada could navigate very shallow waters and easily beach or cast off at will. They were also noticed for their speed, which suited the Celts’ preferred style of battle - lightning raids where the element of surprise was often the key to victory.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_taxes_in_kind	In late antiquity, when the primary mode of wealth was not always a physical currency, it was common for the governments of the Roman Empire and its Germanic successor kingdoms to accept "taxes in kind" from their citizens. This is a system whereby no actual money is exchanged for the reparation of a levied tax. Instead, the repayment is made through the provision of goods or services. In the late Dark and early Middle Ages, taxation in kind became more stratified - the Merovingian system of the 'fisc' (the root of 'fiscal') was the treasury for the vast Frankish lands. Although it was specifically set up to accept taxes in this manner - supposedly making it easier for people to pay - the Frankish Merovingian kings had perennial trouble getting their subjects to actually pay their dues.	true

Gifted land and titles for continued service, they were expected to manage the king's provinces and summon men to war when needed. During the Saxon Wars of AD772-804, the Saxon king Widukind, in his attempt to defeat Charlemagne and frustrate his desire to convert the Saxons to Christianity, was able to incense his nobles to stand behind him against this fiercely Christian threat from the west. Alongside an alliance with the Frisians, Widukind granted many of his warriors autonomous control of their regions in order to incentivise them to drive back the Carolingians.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_military_conquerors	The early Middle Ages was a time defined by fledgling European nations, attempting to find purchase in a world still trying to drag itself out of the chaos of the Dark Ages. The Lombards, Saxons and Avars wanted to make a safe home for their people, yet the Franks under Charlemagne were dogmatic about expanding and spreading their culture and religion across the world. Charlemagne, though a conqueror, was unusually (for the time) concerned with the welfare and wellbeing of his subjects, enacting sweeping educational, administrative and religious reform aimed at educating and healing local communities. He extended this policy to his conquered territories, as long as they abandoned paganism and embraced Christianity as their faith. Broadly the same policy was enacted by the Umayyad Caliphate, although they were notably far more tolerant of other faiths amongst their conquered peoples than Charlemagne. As a counterpoint to this, the Viking excursions and raids across the northern European shores and the British Isles were concerned not with the sentiments of the local populace, but only with the personal gain and glory of the Vikings. They, too, were looking for a place to settle and call home, but they cared little for the people they displaced in order to do so.	true

From here he began his approach, marching along the coast with his fleet following parallel, in step and in full sight at all times. In order to achieve this the Roman crews plyed their oars during calm weather and used smaller sails during squalls to best maintain position with the advancing column on the land.	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_legal_science	The role of law and the legal profession gained increasing traction as the Roman Empire developed, establishing a position of importance next to rhetoric in late antiquity. As Imperial bureaucracy intensified, the profession of law became integral in cutting through the obfuscation before the publication of tomes like the Codex Theodosianus. The Codex itself represented a monumental improvement in Imperial legal science, as it stimulated a proliferation of legal minds under Imperial administration. At first, legal study was folded into aspects of general Roman bureaucracy, with little need for formal training. However, eventually, legal tuition was available in Rome, Ravenna and Constantinople, alongside the school of law that had existed in Berytus for quite some time. Formal legal training gained more importance as late antiquity progressed, and as the roles within the Empire became more specialised. The pretentious and morally pontificating language of the Codex Theodosianus is an example of the kind of training the scholars received, both in law and in rhetoric, painting an image of Imperial majesty and, fittingly, obscurity.	true
technologies_long_description_bel_roman_civil_state_construction_programme	Construction programmes of great magnitude marked Roman civilisation as surely as their conquests across Europe did. Patronage from Emperors resulted in buildings being erected for the arts and religion. In late antiquity, they mainly arose from Roman Christianity, and the transformation of Constantinople into an 'invincible' Roman capital. Over the course of many Emperors, the walls of the city were expanded and reinforced until finally consisting of an outer wall, an inner wall and numerous internal fortifications, all bristling with defences. The walls of Constantinople constituted one of the greatest defensive works of the time, and the last great fortification of antiquity. The monuments, defensive fortifications, and other city constructions were financed by a combination of state money and local funds, as administration of each zone was the responsibility of either the provincial governor for public works or of the military officials for fortifications. The advent of Christianity saw the blossoming of state-sponsored churches across the entire Empire, and none more so than in Constantinople, where 33 churches were raised during the reign of Justinian alone, including what would later go on to become the Hagia Sophia. Built upon and expanded over time, it became an illustrious example of late Roman architecture, and one of the most important buildings in the world.	true

This was considered vital, as goods from the east constituted a colossal proportion of their economy.

In Al-Andalus, natural resources of silver, combined with new developments in agriculture, made the Iberian Peninsula a very attractive trade 'partner' indeed.	true
technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_royal_household	Power always was a fickle partner, and no less so in antiquity. The warrior-led societies of ancient Europe were based primarily on the strength of the individual. Much like Attila's empire in the east, western barbarian kingdoms were held together by the passion and power of their leader. A weak man could be toppled by stronger claimants to his throne. However, there were several ways a leader could maintain power. Victory in battle could help ensure he was feared and respected in equal measure; a man who gained glory on the battlefield was more likely to keep the support of his people. A ruler battered by military defeats would be seen as weak and, more importantly, vulnerable to usurpation by a stronger claimant. Power through law and religion was another way to gain and maintain strength. If the king was also the arbiter in all matters - even meting out 'divine justice' then his power extended to the lowest man, helping to reinforce his position further. Of course, loyalty could also be bought with cold, hard bribery; the distribution of prestigious gifts guaranteed the dedication of subordinate chiefs, at least temporarily.

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_military_siege_techniques	The established norms of siege warfare changed during the Middle Ages. The same general principles of starvation and destruction applied, but as cities became larger and more fortified, the method of cracking these increasingly daunting defences also had to adapt. The onager and ballista were still common sights in a siege engineer's arsenal, but so too were newer, more adventurous weapons like the trebuchet and mangonel. Enormous, beam-sling weapons that hurled rocks (or whatever the general chose - even enemy prisoners!) in gigantic arcs before releasing them, created enormous amounts of force with which the attacker hoped to smash down walls or fire over them to destroy the city beyond. However, not always were these weapons the key to victory - at the Siege of Pavia in AD773-4, Charlemagne failed to bring siege equipment to his assault on the Lombard capital, and so the Frankish king was forced to starve the city out. This, combined with a Lombard failure to adequately prepare for the siege, resulted in their capitulation in June of AD774 - such tried and tested methods of old rarely fail, it seems.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_campaign_planning	During late antiquity, there was little attempt by the European powers to stratify and organise their forces in the same way as the Roman army. In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

Every aspect of society felt the strain of waging conquest or defending against invaders. Men from the Sassanid Empire were drafted from the peasantry to fight, and most likely die, for their lord when the king called them to war. Those not called to fight had their work and produce requisitioned, particularly during last-minute preparations, such as the defence of a city. 	true
technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_irrigation_techniques	Agriculture was - and remains - a difficult endeavour. Water is the crucial factor: rivers and flood plains might be good for growing crops, but a flood can wash away good soil instead of renewing the land. In more arid areas, farmers are reliant on canals and qanats for irrigation, and water must be managed carefully. Basic irrigation systems were widespread in the ancient world because they were simple to maintain. Perennial irrigation was rarer, and required longer canal systems, a method of storage, and better maintenance to ensure that silt and salt build-up was kept in check. For example, in sun-scorched Mesopotamia the river system was able to supply water to the surrounding arable land in the dry season through a system of canals, closed off by dykes and sluice gates. Water was stored in reservoirs, either natural or man-made, and then lifted into the irrigation channels. While this was a labour-intensive task, the results of such toil were remarkable and hugely beneficial to harvests in the area.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_royal_minting	Although the first mints appeared as early as the 7th century BC and spread swiftly around the ancient world, the concept of using coins to define value wasn't adopted by the northern tribes until much later. Prior to the 2nd century BC, bartering and payment-in-kind were widely-used by various tribes and petty kingdoms; the concept of an alternative to treasure that could be accumulated to obtain wealth was alien to the barbarian mindset. Although coins were used by the Celts from that point onwards, the first Germanic ruler to mint in his own name, and bearing his image, was Rechiar, who was king of the Suebi during the 3rd century AD. However, he had other motives aside from the stimulation of the economy, seeing minting, rightly, as a form of propaganda with which to consolidate his powerbase. Once the Vandals and Visigoths occupied former Roman territory they took over much of the ailing Empire's infrastructure, and as such began minting coins from the late 5th century onwards. At first they simply continued to mint 'pseudo-Imperial' coinage such as the 'tremissis' and 'solidus', but eventually reformed the system and produced independent currency using classic designs. Some mints even appropriated Imperial iconography, something that was undoubtedly shocking to their contemporaries but served as a blatant declaration of intent to rule in the Empire's stead.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_military_broad_scouting_initiative	The nomadic steppe armies - and the Huns specifically - scouted out any new regions for potential targets and then considered the surrounding terrain in order to work out the best place to fight the ensuing battle, ensuring that their lethal hit-and-run cavalry tactics achieved the same devastating, battle-winning results for which they had become infamous. Obviously, flat plains were favourable for cavalry charges and skirmishing from horseback; it took space to achieve the speed to smash through massed ranks of enemy infantry or launch complex skirmishing manoeuvres such as the 'Cantabrian Circle' or 'Parthian Shot', both of which were in common usage by the 4th century AD. Once the battlefield had been decided - as always to the nomads' advantage - the first wave of the horde was sent on the offensive to raid and harass the enemy until they were goaded into fighting back. 	true
technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_military_supply_acquisition	'Nomad' peoples followed the seasons with their herds, rather than having a settled agricultural lifestyle. The word itself is a Greek term and, as might be expected of the civilised, settled Greeks, they did not approve of barbarous nomads in the slightest. Nomads, on the other hand, may not have had permanent settlements, but their lives were as full and rich as settled farmer or city dwellers and probably healthier too, as they didn’t live in squalor. Nomadism is an extremely effective way of living off areas with scarce natural resources, such as the steppes. With their herds of domesticated animals nomadic tribesmen travel from camp to camp following the seasons and the grazing they need to maintain. As such, they rely on sheep and goats to provide meat, milk, hides and wool as the basis of their entire way of life. As grazing is exhausted, the herds can be moved on and the land left to recover until the following year. Despite lacking the supposed benefits of a settled community, the ancient nomads could nevertheless prosper. With fearsome warriors among their numbers, they were not above 'foraging' by raiding nearby settlements and farms! This was also an extremely effective and ruthless way of raising troops. The easiest way of harvesting scarce resources is, of course, to take them from someone else. The tribe who could not protect their own livestock, property and kin soon ceased to exist. This also encouraged the worst feature of nomad life for neighbouring, settled peoples: nomads will raid and steal from weak, sedentary folk because they are just another resource to be exploited. 	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_military_forced_conscription_policy	The real strength of the Sassanid army was, primarily, heavy cavalry and seasoned skirmish troops. The Savaran cavalry were led by the 'great' families of noble Persian and Parthian blood. This mounted corps was also often reinforced by mercenaries. Infantry, by contrast, were not usually held in much regard, with some even referring to the levied Paighan – from which the vast majority of Sassanid infantrymen were drawn - as 'a crowd of pitiable peasants'. These poor quality levies were raised by the aristocracy, conscripted from the lands they owned to act, in most cases, as little more than ‘meat shields’ for the Sassanid advance. This social aristocracy bled quite clearly into the military, and remained as the basis for all military recruitment and conscription until the reforms of Khosrow I, who altered the system so that lesser nobility, primarily farmers and land-owners, could be drawn into the army. This dramatically reduced the aristocracy's power, as the armour and weaponry was provided by the state, meaning the newer forces swore loyalty to the Shahanshah himself, and not his local feudal lords.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_taxes_in_kind	In late antiquity, when the primary mode of wealth was not always a physical currency, it was common for the governments of the Roman Empire and its Germanic successor kingdoms to accept "taxes in kind" from their citizens. This is a system whereby no actual money is exchanged for the reparation of a levied tax. Instead, the repayment is made through the provision of goods or services. In the late Dark and early Middle Ages, taxation in kind became more stratified - the Merovingian system of the 'fisc' (the root of 'fiscal') was the treasury for the vast Frankish lands. Although it was specifically set up to accept taxes in this manner - supposedly making it easier for people to pay - the Frankish Merovingian kings had perennial trouble getting their subjects to actually pay their dues.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_billiting	Billeting is the practice of housing troops in privately-owned property. For the Roman army this type of accommodation was known as ‘hospitalitas’, from which we get ‘hospitality’. The troops were given one third of their billet's living space and their rations were provided by the provincial authorities, not their hosts. Troops would know which house they were assigned to because their names would be carved on its door post. Billeting troops became a common occurrence in the 4th and 5th century AD as the Western Romans needed to ensure its troops could quickly reach problem areas in their rapidly deteriorating Empire. The limitanei, or frontier units, were well used to maintaining and defending positions over long periods. Compared to the comitatenses, they were static and entrenched within local populaces. Limitanei were even assigned lands in some provinces and conducted maintenance when they weren't fighting. As such, limes became desirable residences, highlighting how easy it was to exploit troop privileges. The mobile field armies of comitatenses were less static and so were often billeted in cities when on campaign. This, again, provided ample opportunity for exploitation and corruption; the most desirable properties and fertile lands were conveniently appropriated by the army to meet the comitatenses’ needs.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_bronze_casting	'Lost-wax casting' - or 'bronze casting' - dates back thousands of years, its methodology remaining relatively unchanged in that time. The process creates metal (usually bronze) duplicates of sculptures by creating an outer mould of the original sculpture in wax or sometimes clay. Molten wax is then poured in until the shape is defined, forming the inner mould. This is then allowed to cool and set before molten metal (bronze) is poured in and the copy created. Usually, after the process is completed the wax shell is discarded, though in some cases it is retained for further use. The bronze-casting method was so ancient that Pliny spoke of it in his writings, and it was used in ancient India too, according to the Shilpa Shastras texts. As the Medieval age dawned, it was further used by Benedictine Monks such as the noted metalworker and goldsmith Roger of Helmarshausen.	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_local_exchange	The Eastern Roman Empire, at its peak, covered roughly 1.3 million square kilometres. The diversity of climates spanning the vast Imperial holdings ranged from Mediterranean warmth to frigid Balkan forestry, and with this came a wide variety of agricultural output. Wheat was the primary crop, being grown across the majority of the Empire, but also barley, rye and oats - especially in more northern, arid locales. Luxury items, such as olives and wine, were the key financial crops and brought in the most money. The discovery of numerous, tiny pockets of soil in the Syrian massif regions is indicative of a specialised industry there, dedicated to the cultivation and production of olives, much like the specialist vineyards scattered across the Empire. The diversity of the crops grown was used both internally and externally, sustaining both Rome and her people as well as being transported, when possible, to trading partners. As well as Empire-wide and international distribution, evidence suggests that the Near East was also a hub for prosperous local trade; the discovery of coins and pottery across the area attest to this, as does the economic survival of the region far beyond that of more distant Imperial acquisitions, such as Britannia.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_civil_monasticism	Monasticism probably originated in the east, through Coptic Christian doctrine, before spreading to Europe. The monastic life was one of seclusion and strict adherence to Christianity’s fundamental tenets - study, prayer and manual labour away from the pressures of ordinary life. Everything else was considered unimportant and simplified accordingly. For instance, the monks’ mealtimes were rigidly timed and their diets very basic. Monasteries became the centre of the communities they served, as monks were well versed in all manner of skills with which to aid the local populace, and doing so was considered an important Christian duty. As a result, monks took it upon themselves to teach poor boys the Psalms, as well as basic grammar and arithmetic. Furthermore, their study of medicine and pharmaceuticals helped advance healthcare, an area in which the western powers had hitherto fallen far behind their Muslim rivals.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_money_control	To the more pagan, some would say 'primitive', nations of Europe, the concept of money was far more fluid than was the case in the western, Christian kingdoms. Whilst coins were used, they were not valued as highly as goods themselves, which were often bartered or traded like for like. However, if you needed a cow, for instance, but had nothing to exchange, then precious metals and what was known as hacksilver (bits and pieces of random and broken silver regarded to be as good as bullion), could be traded instead. Many Viking treasure hordes found over the years have revealed stores of hacksilver. This is probably because silver was extremely valuable and therefore could only be traded for the most precious and desirable of commodities (large animals, parcels of land, etc.). As the Vikings came into contact with other nations, such as the Franks and Anglo-Saxons, they were exposed to minted coins for the first time and saw the propaganda value of controlling the flow of money and stamping the king's head upon each and every coin.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_maintenance_of_control	Before the rise of Attila, who eventually became king of all the Huns, the Hunnic nation was run by several leaders, with one chief 'king' of them all. These leaders were all semi-independent yet internally ranked against one another. Over time they vanished and an authoritarian, dictatorial system emerged as Attila, at first co-ruling with his brother, Bleda, forged a Hunnic empire. Attila's rule was based primarily on intimidation of every tribe and people he encountered, maintaining power and control over them through terror. The ceaseless savagery Attila inflicted upon those who opposed him served as a warning to others, even forcing super powers such as the Eastern Romans to acquiesce to his diplomatic demands. In order to facilitate this strategy, Attila surrounded himself with various aides and chiefs from other cultures, using them as spies. He kept control of his empire by knowing his enemy's moves and keeping his subjects in check through fear, power and controlling access to information and knowledge. Attila's dictatorial control was so great that its survival was tied almost entirely to him - when he died, the fractures were almost immediate, as lesser tribes supplanted his leadership with their own local leaders, breaking his Hunnic empire apart.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_tithes	War has always been an expensive business, but the funds to pay for it all have to be found somewhere. By the 4th century AD barbarian kings could no longer rely on voluntary support to fuel their military campaigns, forcing them to look elsewhere for the finances to raise and support their armies. For many peoples, their most lucrative assets were agricultural, making farms an obvious target for additional taxation in times of need. Both the Alamanni and Tervingi tribes are known to have levied taxes on agricultural production to pay for the support of their armies. This practice continued well into the Middle Ages; known as 'tithes', the taxable sum was a tenth of the whole - whether that be money or goods. Modern taxation theory also has its roots in such early methods.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_warrior_blood	Battle was an integral part of Dark Age 'barbarian' culture. Tribes frequently fought the neighbouring Germanic, Nordic, Celtic, and nomadic peoples, and even amongst themselves. Inter-tribal battles were generally fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class. Neighbouring rivals raided each other’s territory almost as sport, rather than as a serious, organised attempt to expand their boundaries. On the other hand, the wild Norsemen did so because their land couldn't produce the agricultural yields needed to feed their growing population, eventually settling in places such as England and France, where the conditions were more favourable. For the would-be warrior displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids from the age of fourteen upward. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true

technologies_long_description_att_slav_civil_advanced_agriculture_sclaveni	The Slavs, as a mobile, 'barbarian' culture, were particularly capable farmers - far better, as the Roman Emperor Maurice stated, than "savage warriors". Indeed, he said that they had "an abundance of all kinds of animals and agricultural produce". Archaeological evidence shows a development of Slavic agricultural technology throughout late antiquity. This led to a surplus of supplies that allowed them to thrive and grow. The transient, on-the-move nature of the Slavic tribes also benefited their endeavours - in new areas, they would burn down forests to make room for fields. The ash created was then used as a potent fertiliser. The Slavs would also settle, whenever possible, along valley beds where the soil was fertile and water abundant. Once they had tilled the soil until it was unworkable they would then move somewhere else, allowing the forests to reclaim the used land. However, over time, the Slavs developed a system of crop rotation, allowing some of the fields to lie fallow (ploughed, but not sowed) to restore their fertility. This allowed the land to be worked for much longer, and reduced the need for tribes to relocate. 	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_military_land_grants	Unlike the Roman system of military remuneration, little is known about the Sassanids' methods of paying their standing troops. However, it is known that the army worked in a very feudal sense, with authority trickling down from the Shahanshah to the lesser provincial kings, and then to their subjects. Conscription was enforced; men were drawn to fight for their lord because they were expected to. What is known, however, is that the Sassanid government granted several different land tenures; some private, some state-led, and some communal. Whilst this is information gleaned from their agricultural records, the feudal nature of the army implies that the surviving men, once demobilised, would wish to return to a rural life. A tenure from the government would, therefore, provide the perfect payment.	true

In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

The entire Sassanid military vehicle was streamlined; there are even sources indicating that a manual of 'Military Code' was created; technical literature that detailed organisation of forces, how to care for horses, tactical methodology, riding and archery. The Central Asian influences also helped to transform the rigid, stylistic Sassanid cavalryman into a broad, multi-talented warrior, proficient in spear, bow and sword. It is possible that the Sassanids adopted the cavalry stirrup at the same time. This knowledge was gradually disseminated across the ancient world, creating a new breed of soldier who was the forerunner of the Medieval knight; a trooper, well armoured in mail, adorned with numerous weapons, proficient in all forms of combat, and adaptable to any situation.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_new_economic_freedoms	The reason for Attila's conquest of Europe, and the avalanche of displacement he began, is theorised to have occurred for many possible reasons; climate change, transhumanism or the desire for conquest, yet his ambition cannot be seen as wholly culturally motivated. In fact, Attila embraced an even greater cultural tolerance than eastern nations like the Sassanids, who were accepting of all so long as their laws were obeyed. His aspirations were motivated by a desire for power, for riches and for living space for the Hunnic people. Therefore, those tribes that were amalgamated into his growing empire were welcomed, providing they did all that Attila asked of them. This tolerance of other cultures, combined with Attila's far-ranging conquests, meant cultural osmosis was inevitable as the Huns impacted on their clients and vice versa. For instance, from excavation it is impossible to tell the difference between tools fashioned by the Germanic and Hunnic cultures of the period. Further, the Huns came to learn the Germanic language out of necessity, as well as dress like their barbarian subjects, but that may have been due to the cold weather gripping Europe at the time. It indicates that the Hunnic empire became a fusion of the various steppe nomads and barbarian cultures it encompassed. The way to prosperity was clearly tied to the appropriation of Hunnic culture, and to make oneself as Hun-like as possible. The identity of a man, therefore, became a premium commodity; as the Germanic tribes that were the bulk of Attila's European army became Hunnic, the Huns in turn, became more European.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_christ_civil_manorialism	With the collapse of the Roman Empire, the Europe of the Middle Ages evolved the Roman villa system into three elements; the feudal system, manorialism and serfdom. Feudalism divided the king's land into territories (or 'fiefs'), which were ruled by vassals in his name. Most of the land in Carolingian Europe was held 'allodially', meaning the  vassal was vested with total control and (importantly) defence of the land in the name of the king. Manorialism legitimised the power they had, as the manor became the centre of local legal and economic authority. The lord of the manor became the most important local figure, his subjects tasked with working the land surrounding his castle. At the bottom of this system (often represented by a triangle with the king at the apex) were the serfs, who were made to work in a system only slightly removed from slavery. The serfs farmed for their own gain, but owed their masters a share of the produce that was grown. They were totally dependant on the lord's land to work, and were legally bound never to leave his service.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_royal_minting	Although the first mints appeared as early as the 7th century BC and spread swiftly around the ancient world, the concept of using coins to define value wasn't adopted by the northern tribes until much later. Prior to the 2nd century BC, bartering and payment-in-kind were widely-used by various tribes and petty kingdoms; the concept of an alternative to treasure that could be accumulated to obtain wealth was alien to the barbarian mindset. Although coins were used by the Celts from that point onwards, the first Germanic ruler to mint in his own name, and bearing his image, was Rechiar, who was king of the Suebi during the 3rd century AD. However, he had other motives aside from the stimulation of the economy, seeing minting, rightly, as a form of propaganda with which to consolidate his powerbase. Once the Vandals and Visigoths occupied former Roman territory they took over much of the ailing Empire's infrastructure, and as such began minting coins from the late 5th century onwards. At first they simply continued to mint 'pseudo-Imperial' coinage such as the 'tremissis' and 'solidus', but eventually reformed the system and produced independent currency using classic designs. Some mints even appropriated Imperial iconography, something that was undoubtedly shocking to their contemporaries but served as a blatant declaration of intent to rule in the Empire's stead.	true
technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_suppression_of_non-hun_rulers	In order to fully subjugate conquered peoples, Attila and his Huns developed a system whereby nobles, leaders and intellectuals - in fact, any important, influential member of the subject society - were either killed or taken as hostages. This suppression of the native leadership was done to remove the focal point of any potential uprising and ensure the good behaviour of the people. In their place the nomads installed trusted members of Attila's inner circle, who reported directly to him as part of the Hunnic imperial system of centralised imperial control. 	true
technologies_long_description_bel_roman_civil_local_support	Belisarius knew that, as he marched into Vandalic and, later, Ostrogothic territory, that he would be fighting a war to win not only territory, but the hearts and minds of the people as well. Rather than a subjugation of an enemy, Justinian saw the campaigns as a liberation of Roman citizens from the barbarian yolk. To that end, Belisarius capitalised on the locals to help him secure victory. In Vandalic Africa he fashioned himself as the saviour of the native people, who had kept their Roman identity despite one hundred years of Vandal rule, appealing to them on that basis. He also made a point of punishing those amongst his men who looted or stole and publically praised those who didn't in order to remind his army that, should they be anything less than civil, the population could very quickly turn against them.	true

technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_1_zoroastrism	The struggle for the eastern kings to prove their right to rule manifested in many ways. They made a concerted effort to legitimise themselves through association with a faith - a good example being Zoroastrianism, which eventually became the official Persian state religion. Monuments and reliefs, however, clearly depict the Shahanshah as a warrior, with no misgivings as to his aggressiveness. As elsewhere in the ancient world, the desert kingdoms clearly placed great stock in the military prowess of their leaders, with legitimacy being accorded to victory in war and conquest being seen as the king's duty to his people. Likewise, being associated with the state religion and taking the counsel of senior religious officials was just as important, with some even giving their religious leaders government positions with key responsibilities.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_2_zoroastrism	The creation of an official state religion allowed the rulers of the eastern kingdoms to rapidly establish control, officially blurring the lines between church and state and increasing the power and control of both institutions at the same time. For example, in Sassanid Persia the Avesta, the primary set of Zoroastrian religious texts, were revived as the faith experienced a surge in the ideological power it wielded. In this way, the priesthood grew to wield influence over military and judicial matters as well. By the same token, the king was able to do whatever he wanted as long as he had “divine sanction” – the official approval of Ahura Mazda through his priesthood.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_3_zoroastrism	At its most basic, the core belief in Zoroastrianism is the victory of light and truth (asha) over darkness and deception (druj). The Gathas - most ancient and holy of the Zoroastrian texts - mentions 'yazatas', agents of truth who fight in Ahura Mazda's name. The word yazata derives from 'yaz', meaning "worthy of worship". They embodied asha in their fight against the 'daevas' - the opposite of yazatas, false gods that are the embodiment of druj and the servants of Angra Mainyu, the personification of destruction. The Gathas, written by Zoroaster himself as a series of hymns, invoke the yazatas through prayer and worship. They exist to maintain order, and resist the chaotic influence of Angra Mainyu and his daevas, of which they are the diametric opposites. In many ways the yazatas are analogous to Christianity's heavenly angels, communicating to followers on behalf of their deity.	true

technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_4_zoroastrism	The overarching belief in Zoroastrianism is that good will prevail over evil. Further to that, it is believed that everything was created good but over time evil has managed to corrupt the world. Zoroastrians believe that everything will return to goodness when Frashokereti arrives - a Second Coming-like event which corresponds with the apocalyptic beliefs of other religions. In Avestan, Frashokereti means "making excellent" and was prophesised by Zoroaster himself, who said the final battle against evil would be heralded by the arrival of a "world saviour", the Saoshyant ("one who brings benefit"). The Saoshyant will lead the final battle against evil and, in doing so, usher in Frashokereti. The Saoshyant is believed to be the basis for the concept of a messiah in other monotheistic religions, as he will be born by virgin birth to human parents despite being destined to fight battles beyond the mortal realm. Zoroaster's followers continue to cling ardently to this belief, even though the prophet himself realised the day would not come in his own lifetime.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_christ_civil_court_scholars	Following the collapse of the Roman system along with its Western Empire, the Church gradually established cathedral schools. They were intended as centres of literary, religious and civil learning, as opposed to simply teaching nobles the ways of war. For example, Charlemagne was determined to reform the Frankish Kingdom's educational system in favour of broader educational institutions, so that a greater proportion of his subjects could be educated. He did this by inviting Alcuin, a scholar from York, to his court at Aachen, along with Peter of Pisa and others. Alcuin became Charlemagne's 'prime minister of education' and held sway in all scholastic matters for the entire realm, as well as personally tutoring the king. Later, Charlemagne decreed the 'Charter of Modern Thought', with the view that every boy should be given a basic education, not just the sons of the noble elite.	true

In a more modern context, they are most commonly employed to establish organisations or to ratify city status. Charlemagne used royal charters, however, to shape Europe according to his pious, Christian vision. One of his most famous proclamations is the 'Charter of Modern Thought', which instructed the leaders of the Frankish Church to begin giving free education to every boy within their dioceses, creating one of the first general educational systems of the post-Roman world. Yet Charlemagne's royal charters (of which we know roughly 200, if not more, were decreed) granted land, revenue and protection, as well as issuing other economic and political commandments.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_campaign_planning	During late antiquity, there was little attempt by the European powers to stratify and organise their forces in the same way as the Roman army. In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

Foot archers, in contrast to the majority of eastern infantry, were famed for their skill and importance in battle. Archery training was emphasised as a strong body of archers was seen as key to victory. They were expected to fire as fast and as accurately as possible, creating a screen of missiles that softened the enemy up for the cavalry charge to follow. Some generals even alternated fire between companies of men, so that it was always maintained - a practice adopted centuries later by riflemen as 'fire by rank'.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_maintenance_of_the_irrigation_infrastructure	The Sassanid economy was heavily dependent on agriculture; it was the primary means of earning for the common Persian and the chief means of taxation for the government. The farmers tended to livestock, as well as producing crops of wheat, barley, fruits and vegetables and, although less profitable, rice. Although mainly private sectors, the maintenance of Sassanid agriculture required vast state-led infrastructure, from training to irrigation, and the construction of huge dams and vast qanat networks. This sprawling system of hydraulics was crucial not only for crop cycles, but also for the supply of water to cities where, as well as being reliant on water for basic survival, population growth relied heavily on agricultural output. On a processing level, the transformation of products for sale became more efficient and, in many places, was aided by the state, allowing the Shahanshah to take tighter grip of the Sassanid economy.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_military_warrior_aristocracy	If the collapse of the Roman Empire made one thing clear, it was that life would never – could never – be the same as it had been for centuries prior. The barbarian kingdoms that swept away Rome's remnants assumed much of its workable infrastructure, particularly that relating to the organisation of the armed forces. Of course, this also gave them a means of controlling the young, educated class who might otherwise fight against the new regimes; by offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, their loyalty could be secured. The kingdoms of the late Dark and early Middle Ages were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to be aspired to. Members were obligated to fight for the king, and provide troops from their own retinues, whenever he called them to do so. In return, they were given lands and titles under the proviso they enforced the king's laws and offered protection to the peasants who worked them. In real terms, this was a license to behave in almost any way they liked - the vassals had the weapons and the training to make any point they so chose; the serfs, on the other hand, had none of those things, and therefore no chance to rise up and change their situation. 	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_military_cataphracts	The eastern kingdoms eschewed columns of infantry in favour of a dominant cavalry force able to outmanoeuvre and harass infantry on the plains of the east. Their cavalry took many forms, fielding short swordsmen, light skirmishers and archers, but the most effective weapon was the lance, particularly amongst the cataphract elite. The kontos was a wooden lance, roughly four metres in length, and was much stronger than contemporary Roman and Hellenistic lances. The term 'kataphractoi' is of Greek origin and can be interpreted as 'fully-armoured' or 'closed from all sides'. In military terms, it described heavily-armoured cavalrymen. These shock troops were first fielded as part of Darius’ army at Gaugalema in 352BC. Both rider and mount required excellent stamina, as they were completely enclosed by metal scale armour - and in desert heat too! Cataphract cavalry could use their weight and armour to penetrate an enemy line, but were far less agile than regular horsemen as a result. According to Plutarch, the strength of the lance and the power the rider put behind it meant that, purportedly, it could skewer two men at once!	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_defence_depth	Decisive, pitched battles are not always the best option, especially if you are the outnumbered defender. As borders expanded faster than armies could grow, the idea of "preclusive defence" (a line of border forts and outposts to intercept incursions) became more difficult to maintain. "Defence in depth" was a new concept which allowed the enemy to conquer some ground, but spread them out thinly so they could be dealt with more easily. The defenders then closed around and harassed the weaker portions of the invading army, pushing them back to beyond the borders if not destroying them outright. This defensive strategy was further developed during the Middle Ages with the construction of hill forts and concentric castles, which drew the enemy invaders into layers of defences. Methods such as these exacted a heavy toll on attacking forces, as they repeatedly had to run a gauntlet of missile fire whilst scaling the walls.	true

technologies_long_description_att_slav_civil_the_slavic_code_antes	When the barbarian tribes settled, from the 5th century AD, they gradually began to adopt many of the trappings of 'civilisation'. Nothing if not practical, kings and their free warriors took the existing administrative structure and legal framework and adapted it for their own use. Previously, legal precedents were required to be held in 'advocates' - memories - leading to wildly inconsistent and subjective judgements. Whereas tribal traditions of oral advocacy worked for cultures constantly on the move, tribal laws were adapted to be societal - serving the people as a whole rather than merely resolving isolated conflicts between individuals. As it happened, the barbarians inherited an administrative system that had been in place for many years, during which many of its peculiarities had already been ironed out.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_civil_monasticism	Monasticism probably originated in the east, through Coptic Christian doctrine, before spreading to Europe. The monastic life was one of seclusion and strict adherence to Christianity’s fundamental tenets - study, prayer and manual labour away from the pressures of ordinary life. Everything else was considered unimportant and simplified accordingly. For instance, the monks’ mealtimes were rigidly timed and their diets very basic. Monasteries became the centre of the communities they served, as monks were well versed in all manner of skills with which to aid the local populace, and doing so was considered an important Christian duty. As a result, monks took it upon themselves to teach poor boys the Psalms, as well as basic grammar and arithmetic. Furthermore, their study of medicine and pharmaceuticals helped advance healthcare, an area in which the western powers had hitherto fallen far behind their Muslim rivals.	true

As well as being valuable in and of itself, the document is the first example of Carolingian polyptyques - the inventories of Frankish estates.

'Canonical' law is based on the 'Apostolic Canons', a collection of edicts supposedly set down by the Twelve Apostles (though this is widely contested). The law focused the governing of the church on directing the activity of Catholics and propagating the message of Christianity. It is divided into historiographical eras - the 'jus antiquum' being the earliest, being codified following Emperor Constantine’s Edict of Milan, which accepted Christians as part of the Empire and, moreover, decreed that all wrongs done to them be righted as much as possible. Much later, when Christianity had become the central European religion, canonical law not only dictated the Church’s internal administration, but also ecclesiastical jurisdiction, becoming the basis for much of the region’s secular government.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_elite_military_class	From time immemorial, Germanic barbarian society was built on a class system that placed those with strength and military prowess at its highest levels. Warriors occupied an exulted position, between the nobility and ordinary freemen. Entry into the warrior class required the candidate to be accepted into the retinue of an established warrior; those who fought well and gained prestige could hope to command a warband of their own one day. Although this basic military hierarchy remained essentially unchanged, the expansion of the Empire and the chaos of the Migration Period that followed – where many Germanic peoples spent almost the whole time on the move or on campaign - led to the fusion of warrior bands into permanent military units that stayed together all year round - living, practicing combat, and fighting side-by-side. Over time, they began to become almost indistinguishable from the regional, specialised Roman units, and armies as a whole took on the character of the Roman army.	true

It was not without problems, however. The Codex was hard to properly research, with laws changing even as they were being written. Delays in acquiring information from Rome, Ravenna and private collections made editing it a frustrating process. Nevertheless, the Codex represented a major breakthrough in the documentation of Roman legal processes. It also increased state authority on religious matters, expanding on Christianity's decriminalisation under Constantine and solidly positioning it as Rome's official state religion; one that was intrinsically linked to the role of Emperor.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_large_construction_programme	Construction programmes of great magnitude marked Roman civilisation as surely as their conquests across Europe did. Patronage from Emperors resulted in buildings being erected for the arts and religion. In late antiquity, construction programmes mainly arose out of the advent of Roman Christianity, and from the transformation of Constantinople into an 'invincible' Roman capital. Over the course of many Emperors the walls of the city were expanded and reinforced until finally consisting of an outer wall, an inner wall and numerous internal fortifications, all bristling with defences. The walls of Constantinople constituted one of the greatest defensive works of the time, and the last great fortification of antiquity. The monuments, defensive fortifications, and other city constructions were financed by a combination of state money and local funds, as administration of each zone was the responsibility of either the provincial governor for public works or of the military officials for fortifications. The advent of Christianity saw the blossoming of state-sponsored churches across the entire Empire, none more so than in Constantinople, where 33 churches were raised during the reign of Justinian alone, including the church that would later go on to become the Hagia Sophia. The Hagia Sophia was built on and expanded over time, becoming one of the most illustrious examples of late Roman architecture, and one of the most important architectural creations in the world.	true

Up to that point, the administration of government was far more ad hoc, with the local nobility controlling much of the machinery of state, and little consistency in policy between neighbouring provinces. Corruption amongst the tribal leaders was rife as a result, so centralisation was considered necessary in order to reduce it and guarantee a continuous stream of wealth into the royal coffers. For instance, in the Kingdom of Aksum, government viceroys were appointed to work alongside local officials to ensure that the king’s directives were adhered to.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_warrior_aristocracy	If the collapse of the Roman Empire made one thing clear, it was that life would never – could never – be the same as it had been for centuries prior. The barbarian kingdoms that swept away Rome's remnants assumed much of its workable infrastructure, particularly that relating to the organisation of the armed forces. Of course, this also gave them a means of controlling the young, educated class who might otherwise fight against the new regimes; by offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, their loyalty could be secured. The kingdoms of the late Dark and early Middle Ages were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to be aspired to. Members were obligated to fight for the king, and provide troops from their own retinues, whenever he called them to do so. In return, they were given lands and titles under the proviso they enforced the king's laws and offered protection to the peasants who worked them. In real terms, this was a license to behave in almost any way they liked - the vassals had the weapons and the training to make any point they so chose; the serfs, on the other hand, had none of those things, and therefore no chance to rise up and change their situation. 	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_civil_trade_rights	Whilst those parts of Europe inside the boundaries of the Roman Empire prospered during antiquity, due to the great roads and merchant fleets built to facilitate commerce, northern, Germanic Europe generally languished in relative isolation. This was only made worse by the movement of the Roman capital further east to Constantinople in the 4th century AD, and the great climate change that ravaged the crops and natural wealth of much of northern and eastern Europe during the Migration Period. By the 7th century AD, however, the Merovingian Frankish kings began revitalising trade in northern Europe with a fair at St. Denis, which connected cities across the northern continent, mainly via old Roman roads and the network of rivers that lattice Europe. As the climate change abated, ports and river villages began to become important trade hubs once again, and none more so than the city of Dorestad. Ideally positioned between the Franks and the Frisians, it allowed merchants a convenient half-way point to meet and do business. Its value, however, dragged it into a battle for power between the two, a conflict that widened as the Middle Ages progressed, ultimately leading to the downfall of Dorestad as a major trading city.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_spoila	Throughout late antiquity and the Middle Ages, great shifts in ideology and territorial ownership meant that many buildings and monuments, rather than being destroyed, were modified or repurposed to better suit their new owners' desires. These modifications could be as simple as carving crosses into stones, as in the case of Roman and Greek temples in the 5th century AD, to ward off demons that resided in the previously pagan structures. The Frankish king, Charlemagne, used similar techniques in his Palatine Chapel at Aachen, taking relics from Rome and Ravenna and building them into the new structure - appropriating the style of the Roman Empire to make it abundantly clear that the Frankish Kingdom was its equal in all respects.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_the_barbarian_code	The notion of hereditary monarchy, whereby the crown is passed down to the eldest male heir of a royal family, was a concept quite alien to the new kingdoms of Europe. Their barbarian culture was rooted in leading through strength, and dynastic disputes arose when stronger candidates initiated struggles for the crown. In Ostrogothic Italy, Theoderic left his son-in-law, Eutharic, as his heir. However, Eutharic's death left Theoderic's baby grandson as king, requiring a regent to rule in his stead until he came of age. Though his mother Amalasuntha became regent, the political situation had already become untenable and Theoderic's hard-fought legacy was undone by a violent power struggle. In Vandalic Africa, hereditary monarchy was more successful, as all the kingdom's rulers were of the same family and the crown passed successfully between them as each successive king died. It was the Vandalic kingdom's policies, rather than external bids for power, that caused its ultimate collapse.	true

The increased drafting of tribal warriors also meant a better template for Imperial military operations was required. Evidence suggests that a standardisation of equipment and weaponry took place, due to the existence of fabricae (factories) built inside army bases and at remote frontier stations. In the navy, also, the emphasis was placed on limited, standardised ships and formations to better suit its task of policing and protecting trade in disputed waters.	true

Beasts of burden, Arabian camels evolved to withstand desert conditions much better than horses, which had to be given food, water and shelter in order to survive. Although camels were generally used for trade - carrying goods across the desert - and in army baggage trains, they were also adapted for war - the presence of camel cavalry in eastern armies was noted as early as 853BC. The Arabian Bedouin tribe selectively bred their horses for speed, strength, and endurance, so they were capable of both long-distance travel and calm obedience on the battlefield, becoming renowned throughout the world for their strength and reliability in battle, something which couldn't be said of some western breeds.	true

Possibly in response to the Viking raids across Europe that began at the end of the 8th century AD, other nations - particularly the Carolingian Franks - bolstered their own maritime presence to meet this new threat. Although not as renowned as their armies, the Frankish fleet protected trade routes and seaports from the deadly sea-born raiders. Navies were also strengthened to combat raids on the Mediterranean coast and shipping by the forces of the Islamic caliphates, which increased in strength and ferocity as time went on.	true

For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_civil_church_music	The music of the Christian Church, an essential part of its ceremony, comes from its Jewish forebears, as indeed do many of its rituals and rites. Although debated by scholars, some think the Psalms - integral parts of the Jewish faith - are the origin of both Jewish and Catholic religious song. However, in the middle of the 1st century AD, singing was frowned upon until the development of the church organ in approximately the 7th century, not long after the introduction of the Gregorian chant. Although commonly thought to be a Carolingian invention; a melding together of Roman and Gallic chants, legend attributes it to Pope St. Gregory the Great. Gregorian chant is known for its melisma - the singing of a single syllable over several musical notes - and its characteristic fluctuating melody. In the Middle Ages, singers were urged to extol the virtues of restraint and piety, as befit the message of the Church at that time. This is in opposition to modern Gregorian chants, which are primarily used for mood-setting and atmospherics, particularly when sung with a full choir.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_domain_of_law	The role of law and the legal profession gained increasing traction as the Roman Empire developed, establishing a position of importance next to rhetoric in late antiquity. As Imperial bureaucracy intensified, the profession of law became integral in cutting through the obfuscation before the publication of tomes like the Codex Theodosianus. The Codex itself represented a monumental improvement in Imperial legal science, as it stimulated a proliferation of legal minds under Imperial administration. At first, legal study was folded into aspects of general Roman bureaucracy, with little need for formal training. However, eventually, legal tuition was available in Rome, Ravenna and Constantinople, alongside the school of law that had existed in Berytus for quite some time. Formal legal training gained more importance as late antiquity progressed, and as the roles within the Empire became more specialised. The pretentious and morally pontificating language of the Codex Theodosianus is an example of the kind of training the scholars received, both in law and in rhetoric, painting an image of Imperial majesty and, fittingly, obscurity.	true

Many priests gave palliative as well as pastoral care, but as Christianity blossomed and, subsequently, the science of medicine evolved, the Church got more involved in its ministration. Charlemagne formalised this work, making it central a central tenet of their duty to their congregations. The educational and religious reforms he made aimed to make churches and monasteries the centres of local life, charging the monks with a duty to care for the sick and dying as well as provide education and spiritual repast for all good Christians within his kingdom.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_roman_civil_canonical_law	The advent of Christianity in Europe brought with it the rise of the Church as an institution, and with that the need for a proper, codified system of laws. 'Canonical' law is based on the 'Apostolic Canons', a collection of edicts supposedly set down by the Twelve Apostles (though this is widely contested). The law focused the governing of the church on directing the activity of Catholics and propagating the message of Christianity. It is divided into historiographical eras - the 'jus antiquum' being the earliest, being codified following Emperor Constantine’s Edict of Milan, which accepted Christians as part of the Empire and, moreover, decreed that all wrongs done to them be righted as much as possible. Much later, when Christianity had become the central European religion, canonical law not only dictated the Church’s internal administration, but also ecclesiastical jurisdiction, becoming the basis for much of the region’s secular government.	true

The Roman diplomat Priscus, who spent time at Attila's court, wrote that the Huns carried rafts or pontoons on their wagons to allow them to cross marshy ground. Sadly, he didn’t go in to detail regarding the materials used, however we can assume that they would have been light and easy to manoeuvre. Of course, carrying anything substantial would have slowed the Huns down, so it is likely that the rafts were made up of a combination of wood, wickerwork and hides. 	true

Investigation into more natural solutions revealed preliminary understanding of atomics, which fed into understanding of the elements. As the Romans conquered their philosophy expanded to become self-aggrandising; Rome conquered, thus Rome was right. Great edifices to their glory, and to the gods, were erected from concrete in impressively short timeframes. Christianity, and the notion of the Emperor's semi-divinity, later bolstered the self-absorbed notion of Roman philosophy and its outlook on the world - the Emperor was charged with the task of uniting the world, in the name of God! This notion persisted among the barbarian kingdoms that followed the Empire, into the Middle Ages and beyond - the monarch was chosen by God himself to rule on His behalf. 	true
technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_military_conquerors	The early Middle Ages was a time defined by fledgling European nations, attempting to find purchase in a world still trying to drag itself out of the chaos of the Dark Ages. The Lombards, Saxons and Avars wanted to make a safe home for their people, yet the Franks under Charlemagne were dogmatic about expanding and spreading their culture and religion across the world. Charlemagne, though a conqueror, was unusually (for the time) concerned with the welfare and wellbeing of his subjects, enacting sweeping educational, administrative and religious reform aimed at educating and healing local communities. He extended this policy to his conquered territories, as long as they abandoned paganism and embraced Christianity as their faith. Broadly the same policy was enacted by the Umayyad Caliphate, although they were notably far more tolerant of other faiths amongst their conquered peoples than Charlemagne. As a counterpoint to this, the Viking excursions and raids across the northern European shores and the British Isles were concerned not with the sentiments of the local populace, but only with the personal gain and glory of the Vikings. They, too, were looking for a place to settle and call home, but they cared little for the people they displaced in order to do so.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_military_logistics	An army can live off the land in most places. What can’t be found, stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried. This meant arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load, medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable, as opposed to just plain miserable. Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or exhausted. He will not give his best in such circumstances, no matter how inspiring the leadership qualities of his commanders.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_military_army_drills	Although many barbarian peoples favoured ambush and shock tactics, there were some who developed techniques especially for use in pitched battles. The Germans, for instance, favoured columns, and when warriors from different tribes fought together each tribe formed its own column. This not only allowed them to fight in their own styles - using their own chants and war dances - but created rivalry on the battlefield, encouraging warriors to prove their fighting prowess to their neighbours. At the Battle of Pollentia the Visigoths displayed their tactical prowess by using cavalry to cut off the Roman retreat, whilst their infantry trapped the Emperor Honorius by preventing his withdrawal into the capital he was attempting to flee. This level of co-ordination could not have been achieved without extensive drilling of their forces, something which must’ve seemed entirely alien to them at the time.	true

At the time, the Patriarch of Alexandria was part of the Pentarchy - the five major Christian Sees that oversaw the administration of the Church - and he ruled that Frumentius himself was best suited to the task, consecrating him as Bishop in AD328.

technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_4_eastern_church_axum	Asceticism is the practice of living as simple a life as possible, rejecting material objects and physical desires with the intention of aiding the pursuit of spiritual understanding. An example of extreme religious devotion, the roots of the practice come from disciplined philosophical and physical training. The word 'asceticism' comes from the Greek word 'askesis', meaning "to train". Ancient Greek athletes practised celibacy to hone their minds and bodies for the physical trials that lay ahead; philosophers trained their minds to resist the lure of physical pleasure. Probably the most famous ascetic was Saint Simeon Stylites, who lived in Aleppo, Syria, atop a pillar for 37 years. He attempted to remove himself thoroughly from the material and physical pleasures of life to achieve a greater spirituality and understanding of God.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_siege_techniques	The established norms of siege warfare changed during the Middle Ages. The same general principles of starvation and destruction applied, but as cities became larger and more fortified, the method of cracking these increasingly daunting defences also had to adapt. The onager and ballista were still common sights in a siege engineer's arsenal, but so too were newer, more adventurous weapons like the trebuchet and mangonel. Enormous, beam-sling weapons that hurled rocks (or whatever the general chose - even enemy prisoners!) in gigantic arcs before releasing them, created enormous amounts of force with which the attacker hoped to smash down walls or fire over them to destroy the city beyond. However, not always were these weapons the key to victory - at the Siege of Pavia in AD773-4, Charlemagne failed to bring siege equipment to his assault on the Lombard capital, and so the Frankish king was forced to starve the city out. This, combined with a Lombard failure to adequately prepare for the siege, resulted in their capitulation in June of AD774 - such tried and tested methods of old rarely fail, it seems.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_circulation_of_laws	Zoroastrianism was the primary religion of the Sassanids. It did not become the official religion of the empire until much later, but the Shahanshahs had an interesting and continued relationship with the faith from the inception of the empire under Ardashir I. The sanction, by the Zoroastrian church, helped to legitimise the administration and empower the new king. A legitimate, religiously-approved king would be better liked by his pious subjects, and allow him to become a patron for the religion, benefiting both institutions. Although Ardashir identified as broadly Zoroastrian, Shapur I was determined to officialise the religion; he founded many fire temples across Persian territory and vested his own man, Kirder, with the power to implement sweeping religious changes. Shapur, in this way, laid the groundwork for later Shahs to take control of, and institutionalise, the Zoroastrian faith - as Yazdegerd II eventually achieved.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_troop_organisation	During late antiquity, there was little attempt by the European powers to stratify and organise their forces in the same way as the Roman army. In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_legal_training	The role of law and the legal profession gained increasing traction as the Roman Empire developed, establishing a position of importance next to rhetoric in late antiquity. As Imperial bureaucracy intensified, the profession of law became integral in cutting through the obfuscation before the publication of tomes like the Codex Theodosianus. The Codex itself represented a monumental improvement in Imperial legal science, as it stimulated a proliferation of legal minds under Imperial administration. At first, legal study was folded into aspects of general Roman bureaucracy, with little need for formal training. However, eventually, legal tuition was available in Rome, Ravenna and Constantinople, alongside the school of law that had existed in Berytus for quite some time. Formal legal training gained more importance as late antiquity progressed, and as the roles within the Empire became more specialised. The pretentious and morally pontificating language of the Codex Theodosianus is an example of the kind of training the scholars received, both in law and in rhetoric, painting an image of Imperial majesty and, fittingly, obscurity.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_network_of_messengers	Attila had eyes everywhere. In the empire business this was an essential intrigue if you wanted to stay alive long enough to enjoy the spoils of your conquest. A good example of Attila's spy network in action was related by the 5th century Roman diplomat, Priscus of Panium. Unbeknownst to both Priscus and his fellow ambassadors, agents of the Emperor Theodosius had planted several assassins within his party with orders to kill Attila when the time was right. However, there was a double-agent in their midst; Edeco was in on the plot but warned his master when the party reached Attila's camp. With their secret out the assassins expected nothing but death, but to everyone's great surprise Attila instead sent them home unmolested. Maybe it was important to show Theodosius that his every move was known and could be countered or maybe he intended to use the incident to secure even greater tribute from Rome? Whatever his intentions, with this move Attila clearly proved himself the more powerful man.	true

These modifications could be as simple as carving crosses into stones, as in the case of Roman and Greek temples in the 5th century AD, to ward off demons that resided in the previously pagan structures. The Frankish king, Charlemagne, used similar techniques in his Palatine Chapel at Aachen, taking relics from Rome and Ravenna and building them into the new structure - appropriating the style of the Roman Empire to make it abundantly clear that the Frankish Kingdom was its equal in all respects.	true

technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_4_zoroastrism_lakhmid	The overarching belief in Zoroastrianism is that good will prevail over evil. Further to that, it is believed that everything was created good but over time evil has managed to corrupt the world. Zoroastrians believe that everything will return to goodness when Frashokereti arrives - a Second Coming-like event which corresponds with the apocalyptic beliefs of other religions. In Avestan, Frashokereti means "making excellent" and was prophesised by Zoroaster himself, who said the final battle against evil would be heralded by the arrival of a "world saviour", the Saoshyant ("one who brings benefit"). The Saoshyant will lead the final battle against evil and, in doing so, usher in Frashokereti. The Saoshyant is believed to be the basis for the concept of a messiah in other monotheistic religions, as he will be born by virgin birth to human parents despite being destined to fight battles beyond the mortal realm. Zoroaster's followers continue to cling ardently to this belief, even though the prophet himself realised the day would not come in his own lifetime.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_3_zoroastrism_lakhmid	At its most basic, the core belief in Zoroastrianism is the victory of light and truth (asha) over darkness and deception (druj). The Gathas - most ancient and holy of the Zoroastrian texts - mentions 'yazatas', agents of truth who fight in Ahura Mazda's name. The word yazata derives from 'yaz', meaning "worthy of worship". They embodied asha in their fight against the 'daevas' - the opposite of yazatas, false gods that are the embodiment of druj and the servants of Angra Mainyu, the personification of destruction. The Gathas, written by Zoroaster himself as a series of hymns, invoke the yazatas through prayer and worship. They exist to maintain order, and resist the chaotic influence of Angra Mainyu and his daevas, of which they are the diametric opposites. In many ways the yazatas are analogous to Christianity's heavenly angels, communicating to followers on behalf of their deity.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_2_zoroastrism_lakhmid	The creation of an official state religion allowed the rulers of the eastern kingdoms to rapidly establish control, officially blurring the lines between church and state and increasing the power and control of both institutions at the same time. For example, in Sassanid Persia the Avesta, the primary set of Zoroastrian religious texts, were revived as the faith experienced a surge in the ideological power it wielded. In this way, the priesthood grew to wield influence over military and judicial matters as well. By the same token, the king was able to do whatever he wanted as long as he had “divine sanction” – the official approval of Ahura Mazda through his priesthood.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_1_zoroastrism_lakhmid	The struggle for the eastern kings to prove their right to rule manifested in many ways. They made a concerted effort to legitimise themselves through association with a faith - a good example being Zoroastrianism, which eventually became the official Persian state religion. Monuments and reliefs, however, clearly depict the Shahanshah as a warrior, with no misgivings as to his aggressiveness. As elsewhere in the ancient world, the desert kingdoms clearly placed great stock in the military prowess of their leaders, with legitimacy being accorded to victory in war and conquest being seen as the king's duty to his people. Likewise, being associated with the state religion and taking the counsel of senior religious officials was just as important, with some even giving their religious leaders government positions with key responsibilities.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_army_drills	Although many barbarian peoples favoured ambush and shock tactics, there were some who developed techniques especially for use in pitched battles. The Germans, for instance, favoured columns, and when warriors from different tribes fought together each tribe formed its own column. This not only allowed them to fight in their own styles - using their own chants and war dances - but created rivalry on the battlefield, encouraging warriors to prove their fighting prowess to their neighbours. At the Battle of Pollentia the Visigoths displayed their tactical prowess by using cavalry to cut off the Roman retreat, whilst their infantry trapped the Emperor Honorius by preventing his withdrawal into the capital he was attempting to flee. This level of co-ordination could not have been achieved without extensive drilling of their forces, something which must’ve seemed entirely alien to them at the time.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_civil_land_grants	In order to cement and legitimise their rule, the former 'barbarian' kingdoms sought to go further than merely adding a layer of their most prestigious people on top of the old Roman societal infrastructure. Alliances were forged and loyalty secured through intermarriage between ruling houses, a practice which continued right up to the modern age. Another way of maintaining stability was to 'buy' allegiances via the gifting of strategically-positioned territories, thus ensuring that potential rivals were placated and, rather more cynically, so 'buffer' states existed between the giver and any hostile powers. Initially all this was designed in order to present a united front against the Byzantine Romans – who would surely come to reclaim their former Empire in the west – but eventually was just a way of keeping the emergent royal houses in control of their kingdoms.	true

It is therefore not surprising that they were able to develop the fastest cavalry the Romans had ever seen. Smaller than their western counter parts and far sturdier, the Turkish ponies favoured by the steppe peoples were also much better at climbing, swimming, and jumping. They could survive harsh climates and live on grass alone, meaning that when the Huns expanded their empire they didn’t have to limit their attacks to places where sufficient fodder could be found. This ease of care also meant steppe warriors were able to maintain several horses when migrating or on campaign, making it possible for them cover greater distances without needing to rest their mounts.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_enhanced_troop_privileges	One of Constantine's chief changes to the structure of the Roman military was splitting the deployment of troops into a two-tier system; garrison forces known as limitanei, and the combative field armies - the comitatenses. The rationale behind this reorganisation was that there would always be a sufficient force to deploy in the event of crisis. As well as this, the overarching, powerful positions of Magister Peditum and Magister Equitum delineated power from the previously all-powerful Magister Militum. Although these offices existed beneath him, the Magister Militum still wielded supreme military power and commanded the Legions of comitatenses directly. The splitting of his role, necessary once Rome's military infrastructure became too unwieldy, enhanced the status of both infantry and cavalry as elite troops, with privileges being afforded to their new, prestigious positions.	true

Many priests gave palliative as well as pastoral care, but as Christianity blossomed and, subsequently, the science of medicine evolved, the Church got more involved in its ministration. Charlemagne formalised this work, making it central a central tenet of their duty to their congregations.

By the 4th century AD barbarian kings could no longer rely on voluntary support to fuel their military campaigns, forcing them to look elsewhere for the finances to raise and support their armies. For many barbarian peoples, their most lucrative assets were agricultural, making farms an obvious target for additional taxation in times of need.

Such a naval trade network required a powerful navy to protect it, and so the Umayyads fielded a mighty fleet built from the Iberian Peninsula's abundant timber resources. Umayyad ships were known to be generally larger than other ships of the period and, not content to simply protect trade, the fleet also took an active role in raiding. At first they raided the coast but, emboldened by success and good fortune, began striking out into the Mediterranean proper, eventually becoming known for piracy and showing no mercy to any  ship unfortunate enough to cross their path.

technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_regionalisation_of_the_army	It was Constantine the Great who, in the 4th century AD, reformed the Roman army from the system that had been in place since the 2nd. In many ways, Constantine built on the initiatives of earlier Emperors such as Gallienus and even Severus, more clearly defining the roles of the standing Imperial army, and increasing its overall size significantly. The reforms established firm roles, such as comitatenses and limitanei - roaming armies and frontier troops respectively. This, in conjunction with the general reduction in size of individual Imperial armies, indicated Constantine's trend of creating specialised function, also shown in the specific names of units such as lanciarii, clibinarii and balistarii. It also promoted regionalisation, as limitanei forces dug in at their locations like a garrison, whereas the smaller comitatenses armies would deploy as needed to provinces throughout the Empire. Constantine's reforms further delineated the previously homogenous approach, instead creating smaller clusters that reduced his armies' logistical cost; each force was sent only where it was needed, reducing frivolous expenditure and placing it nearer to necessary production facilities.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_judicial_power	Charlemagne's revisions to the Frankish legal system in AD780 established the position of 'scabini' - the basis for the modern legal position of 'assessor', the assistant and counsel to a judge or magistrate in most central and northern European countries. Each court was represented by seven scabini, who were, in essence, legal encyclopaedias, theoretically possessing all there was to know about Frankish and Salic law between them. These men were held in particularly high esteem and reported directly to the judge or, in many cases, passed judgement themselves based on their understanding of legal precedents. Carolingian law also forbade judges, in a bizarrely obvious move, from accepting bribes and told them to make decisions based solely on evidence and inquest. They were also to keep with them at all times a copy of the 'Lex Ripuara' -  a collection of Germanic law and the basis and inspiration for the later 'Lex Salica'.	true
technologies_long_description_att_eastern_military_mercenary_employment_strategies	The backbone of the Sassanid military was a strong cavalry core, drawn from Azadan nobility. These aristocratic families provided wealth to field cavalry and, most notably, created the hammer blow of armies in the cataphracts. They also levied their own province's peasants to form an ill-equipped, poorly-trained infantry, who were little more than cannon fodder. Yet holes in the military machine still existed, and had to be plugged. Specifically, the lighter cavalry, as well as higher class infantry, were drawn from Sassanid allies such as the Khazars and the Dailamites. Miscellaneous mercenary supplements were also employed to pad out the elite nucleus of Sassanid armies.	true

Some historians argue that the addition of fortifications was not a defensive decision but was, in fact, a matter of prestige.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_english_civil_insular_art	In the British Isles, a distinct style of manuscript art emerged, called 'insular' art, from the Latin 'insula' (island). Insular art is much more dense and imaginative than illuminations from the continent, with spirals and complicated geometric shapes appearing - possibly due to Celtic influences. The Germanic influence and traditions of the Anglo-Saxons also saw pagan motifs - animals and nature - featuring heavily. The Book of Kells, an Irish version of the Bible from approximately AD800, is one of the most intricately decorated examples of insular art to have survived to the present day, with entire pages of vibrant colours, intricate shapes and complicated patternwork.	true
technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_fixed_land_tax	Although the Sassanids had coins minted, they appear to have been used for much more ceremonial purposes, and when used as economic tools they fast became devalued and mixed with older Arsacid coins. The chief means of economic mobility was therefore primarily barter. In lieu of a strong fiscal motivation, taxation was based on crop-sharing and valuation of crop yields per annum. In addition to a tax on the land, a poll tax was brought against the people themselves, who although offered the option of paying in coin, would more than likely pay instead with goods and crops. Although the taxation system brought coin to the royal coffers, it was seen as inefficient and wasteful; it couldn't take into account fluctuations in land and agricultural yield, and therefore couldn't be planned in advance. It also put a very heavy burden on the common Sassanid peasant, yet all this was initially insignificant to the Shahanshah, who saw his coffers filled with taxed gold.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_conquerors	The early Middle Ages was a time defined by fledgling European nations, attempting to find purchase in a world still trying to drag itself out of the chaos of the Dark Ages. The Lombards, Saxons and Avars wanted to make a safe home for their people, yet the Franks under Charlemagne were dogmatic about expanding and spreading their culture and religion across the world. Charlemagne, though a conqueror, was unusually (for the time) concerned with the welfare and wellbeing of his subjects, enacting sweeping educational, administrative and religious reform aimed at educating and healing local communities. He extended this policy to his conquered territories, as long as they abandoned paganism and embraced Christianity as their faith. Broadly the same policy was enacted by the Umayyad Caliphate, although they were notably far more tolerant of other faiths amongst their conquered peoples than Charlemagne. As a counterpoint to this, the Viking excursions and raids across the northern European shores and the British Isles were concerned not with the sentiments of the local populace, but only with the personal gain and glory of the Vikings. They, too, were looking for a place to settle and call home, but they cared little for the people they displaced in order to do so.	true
technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_grain_exchange	Along with water, food is one of the basic human needs. When a population’s staple diet is bread, being able to effectively manage its production is an essential skill. In the ancient world, common threats such as warfare, flooding or drought could ruin a harvest. By storing excess grain from successful harvests a nation not only ensured its own safety, but also enabled it to assist others – making grain a powerful diplomatic tool. Consequently, control of its granaries was often the issue at the centre of internal power struggles. This is vividly demonstrated by the discovery of model granaries buried along with their owners to demonstrate the deceased’s agricultural power.	true

The barbarian kingdoms that swept away Rome's remnants assumed much of its workable infrastructure, particularly that relating to the organisation of the armed forces. By offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, loyalty could be secured. The kingdoms of the late Dark and early Middle Ages were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to aspire to. Members were obligated to fight for the king and provide troops from their own retinues whenever he called them to do so. In return, they were given lands and titles under the proviso that they enforced the king's laws and offered protection to the peasants who worked their lands. In real terms, this was a license to behave in almost any way the vassals liked - they had the weapons and the training to make any point they so chose; the serfs, on the other hand, had none of those things, and therefore no chance to rise up and change their situation.	true

The 'Codex Theodosianus', as it was known, took 22 experts nine years to pull together across sixteen volumes, and represented the majority of Rome's legal framework, codified for first time since the foundation of the 'Twelve Tables'. It was not without problems, however. The Codex was hard to properly research, with laws changing even as they were being written. Delays in acquiring information from Rome, Ravenna and private collections made editing it a frustrating process. Nevertheless, the Codex represented a major breakthrough in the documentation of Roman legal processes. It also increased state authority on religious matters, expanding on Christianity's decriminalisation under Constantine and solidly positioning it as Rome's official state religion; one that was intrinsically linked to the role of Emperor.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_civil_church_music	The music of the Christian Church, an essential part of its ceremony, comes from its Jewish forebears, as indeed do many of its rituals and rites. Although debated by scholars, some think the Psalms - integral parts of the Jewish faith - are the origin of both Jewish and Catholic religious song. However, in the middle of the 1st century AD, singing was frowned upon until the development of the church organ in approximately the 7th century, not long after the introduction of the Gregorian chant. Although commonly thought to be a Carolingian invention; a melding together of Roman and Gallic chants, legend attributes it to Pope St. Gregory the Great. Gregorian chant is known for its melisma - the singing of a single syllable over several musical notes - and its characteristic fluctuating melody. In the Middle Ages, singers were urged to extol the virtues of restraint and piety, as befit the message of the Church at that time. This is in opposition to modern Gregorian chants, which are primarily used for mood-setting and atmospherics, particularly when sung with a full choir.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_battle_experience	Battle was an integral part of Dark Age 'barbarian' culture. Tribes frequently fought the neighbouring Germanic, Nordic, Celtic, and nomadic peoples, and even amongst themselves. Inter-tribal battles were generally fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class. Neighbouring rivals raided each other’s territory almost as sport, rather than as a serious, organised attempt to expand their boundaries. On the other hand, the wild Norsemen did so because their land couldn't produce the agricultural yields needed to feed their growing population, eventually settling in places such as England and France, where the conditions were more favourable. For the would-be warrior displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids from the age of fourteen upward. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_military_skirmish_supplies	Silver seams, mined by both Carthage and Rome in centuries past, were reopened by the Umayyads, who then used the resultant wealth to import well-made weapons and armour from across Europe as well as creating their own. Less is known about Andalusian infantry than their cavalry, save that they represented the bulk of Umayyad armies in the region at a time when their cavalry was considered inferior and insufficient for purpose compared to that of their western European rivals. Although the amount of cavalry fielded increased over time, the numbers remained biased in favour of infantry (and weight of numbers at that) for much of the early Middle Ages. Drawn from the native Andalusian and north African Berber populations, infantry had to be proficient in both melee and skirmishing techniques and carried both axes and bows, so their battlefield role could be changed by the general according to the tactical situation with which they were presented. Despite advances in horse archery elsewhere in the world - and particularly in the east - skirmishing remained primarily an infantry role; horse archers were used, but were not a common sight in western Umayyad armies of the period.	true

Investigation into more natural solutions revealed preliminary understanding of atomics, which fed into understanding of the elements. As the Romans conquered their philosophy expanded to become self-aggrandising; Rome conquered, thus Rome was right. Great edifices to their glory, and to the gods, were erected from concrete in impressively short timeframes. Christianity, and the notion of the Emperor's semi-divinity, later bolstered the self-absorbed notion of Roman philosophy and its outlook on the world - the Emperor was charged with the task of uniting the world, in the name of God! This notion persisted among the barbarian kingdoms that followed the Empire, into the Middle Ages and beyond - the monarch was chosen by God himself to rule on His behalf. 	true
technologies_long_description_bel_roman_civil_uninterrupted_business	Belisarius' expedition hinged on the idea that the Romans were a liberating force, freeing the local populace from the yoke of barbarian oppression - it was a battle for hearts and minds as much as territory. For this plan to be successful, it was imperative that the civilian population and the cities in which they lived were left intact as far as possible and not subjected to sacking and massacre, as was often the case during the ancient period. When Belisarius marched into Carthage after his victory over Gelimer at the Battle of Ad Decimum, he gave his men specific instructions that there would be no looting or rioting, and that peace would be maintained. Such was the discipline displayed by the Roman forces that the everyday working life of the city remained uninterrupted - shops stayed open and the business of the day, despite the arrival of Belisarius' army, was unaffected.	true

It took great resourcefulness and no little tenacity to scour the surrounding area for those things that made the nomadic lifestyle - and fighting style - possible. As the steppe peoples' chief weapons were the composite bow and kontos-style lance the wood required had to be scavenged, traded for, or stolen in order to make the thousands of arrows and spears needed for each campaign. Once the materials had been acquired it was then necessary to organise a production line, making the best of the nomads' artisan skills of fletching and carving, and of course making use of their most abundant resource - slave labour - to achieve their ends. 	true

Gone were the days when they could rely heavily on ambush tactics and the headlong charge, now they were far more likely to be involved in sieges and pitched battles on terrain they were unaccustomed to. Some, like the Vandals, even fought at sea. This made them the first tribe to possess a fleet in the Mediterranean; one that would go on to enable their conquest of much of the region, defeating several seasoned Roman naval commanders along the way. 	true
technologies_long_description_bel_roman_military_forced_capitulation	Belisarius was a general of measure - he seldom resorted to vengeance and remembered at all times that he was reclaiming old Roman cities, not putting barbarian hovels to the torch; it would not do for them to be destroyed in the process. In AD539, he decided to march on Ravenna in an attempt to swiftly end the war. This decision came in the aftermath of defeat and near-starvation during the siege of Mediolanum, following which the Ostrogoths sacked the city. Determined that the same thing would not happen a second time, Belisarius besieged the strongholds of Auximum and Faesulae before he reached the capital. Despite the Franks' surprise attack, in an attempt to defeat both Romans and Ostrogoths together, they failed and the towns fell quickly without the Imperial army having to lose men and resources in costly assaults that would also destroy them (although he demolished their fortifications afterwards). Starved into surrender, the populations may not have been so lucky.	true

technologies_long_description_att_celtic_broch_towers	During the Dark Ages, many round towers were constructed in northern parts of the British Isles, known as ‘brochs’ in Scotland, and ‘cloigtheach’ in Ireland. Although the reasons for their construction are unclear, their names give clues as to their purpose. ‘Cloigtheach’ means ‘bell house’ and ‘broch’ has its roots in the word ‘brough’, a lowland word for fort and similar in meaning to the Germanic ‘burg’ and ‘borough’. This, along with the clusters of village buildings at their feet, indicates that round towers were intended for both defensive and administrative purposes. The defensive aspect is also borne out by their height – up to forty metres – which enabled a 360 degree view of the surrounding land (and therefore any approaching forces) and the fact that the entrance door was usually several feet up, with a ladder which could be raised or lowered to give access or postholes into which wooden steps could be inserted for the same purpose. However, the position of the door could also be a matter of stability, as the foundations used were surprisingly shallow - so a ground level door would weaken the structure. Rooms within the towers were generally positioned inside a second wall, with stairs between the two to give access to the upper levels. This made them very secure and therefore a likely place to keep valuables safe from marauding raiders.	true

The advent of defined currencies in gold, silver, bronze and electrum improved matters somewhat, as it was no longer as easy to argue about what something was worth, and therefore how much tax should be paid to the crown. The development of coinage was also symptomatic of the vast amounts of frankincense, myrrh, copper, ivory, glassware, and slaves being traded, so organised tax calculation and collection systems were necessary just to keep officials aware of (most of) what was going on.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_conquerors	The early Middle Ages was a time defined by fledgling European nations, attempting to find purchase in a world still trying to drag itself out of the chaos of the Dark Ages. The Lombards, Saxons and Avars wanted to make a safe home for their people, yet the Franks under Charlemagne were dogmatic about expanding and spreading their culture and religion across the world. Charlemagne, though a conqueror, was unusually (for the time) concerned with the welfare and wellbeing of his subjects, enacting sweeping educational, administrative and religious reform aimed at educating and healing local communities. He extended this policy to his conquered territories, as long as they abandoned paganism and embraced Christianity as their faith. Broadly the same policy was enacted by the Umayyad Caliphate, although they were notably far more tolerant of other faiths amongst their conquered peoples than Charlemagne. As a counterpoint to this, the Viking excursions and raids across the northern European shores and the British Isles were concerned not with the sentiments of the local populace, but only with the personal gain and glory of the Vikings. They, too, were looking for a place to settle and call home, but they cared little for the people they displaced in order to do so.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_advanced_siegecraft_techniques	As the Western Roman Empire slid into decline attacks on Rome itself became more frequent. Although Rome was no longer the capital it was still the ‘eternal city’ and continued to hold an important position in the imaginations of Romans. During the 5th and 6th centuries AD, three separate tribal confederations attacked Rome; in AD410 the Visigoths sacked the city, followed by the Vandals in AD455, and finally the Ostrogoths in AD546. All of these tribes knew that the key to the city's surrender was to cut off its grain supply. When Alaric I, King of the Visigoths, besieged Rome he made sure to destroy the granaries at Portus, the large artificial harbour that served the city, ensuring famine amongst the Romans and therefore a swift, favourable end to the siege. 	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_local_nobility	In order to cement and legitimise their rule, the western barbarians sought to go further than merely adding a layer of their most prestigious people on top of existing Roman society. The Ostrogothic king, Theoderic the Great, for instance, immediately forged alliances through the marriage of his most loyal free men to the daughters of Roman nobles and those of his barbarian rivals amongst the Vandals, etc. in order that society might quickly return to a sense of normality and community, and life might go on relatively unhindered. There was an ulterior motive, however, in that Theoderic wished barbarian Europe to stand behind him against the Eastern Roman Empire and any attempts they may make to recapture the territory lost following the West's collapse. Unfortunately, his marriage-alliance policy was only partially successful; the Visigoths were soon at war with the Franks and Theoderic's alliance with the Vandals floundered after the death of Thrasamund, a fellow Arian Christian and enemy of Constantinople.	true

Possibly in response to the Viking raids across Europe that began at the end of the 8th century AD, other nations - particularly the Carolingian Franks - bolstered their own maritime presence to meet this new threat. Although not as renowned as their armies, the Frankish fleet protected trade routes and seaports from the deadly sea-born raiders. Navies were also strengthened to combat raids on the Mediterranean coast and shipping by the forces of the Islamic caliphates, which increased in strength and ferocity as time went on.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_military_campaign_planning	During late antiquity, there was little attempt by the European powers to stratify and organise their forces in the same way as the Roman army. In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

technologies_long_description_att_slav_civil_payment_in_gold_antes	The system of 'foederati' originally made the Roman Empire powerful, aiding in their subjugation of barbarian tribes. However, as time went on, it helped to cripple them as they were forced tor rely more and more on barbarian federate forces to fight their wars for them. Proximity to the Empire often meant that it was simply a matter of time before a people came into their sphere of influence, and so it was with the Slavs. The Anteans, close to Eastern Roman borders, were offered foederati status in exchange for gold and military service - a bulwark against the marauding steppe nomads. As a result, the Romans gifted the Anteans a fort on the strategically important Danube river. They were also expected to take part in Rome's wars, which they continued to do until destroyed and assimilated by the Avars in the 7th century AD.	true
technologies_long_description_att_slav_civil_advanced_silverworks_sclaveni	Due to their transient and mobile nature, the Slavs of late antiquity were not great miners of mineral resources and precious metals. As such, there is no historical evidence of any real Slavic mining activity. However, they did import large amounts of silver; unearthed burial sites have revealed the kinds of things the Slavs hoarded and sent with their dead to the grave. One discovered in Moldova contained myriad pieces of metalwork, including two silver spurs, a silver knife and an ornate silver fibula brooch. Other sites contained silver buttons and beads. Clearly, the Slavs put great importance on their valuable items - perhaps including them in graves as votive offerings for the gods. In order to make these items they became highly adept at working with silver and indeed Slavic silverwork has been found all over Europe, including in the graves of Vikings, who no doubt plundered it from someone else!	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_improved_incendiary_warfare	The history of warfare in the Roman age is incredibly well documented so we are able to build a clear and concise picture of the battles they fought, and the weapons and techniques they used. Yet there is one weapon that remains a mystery, 'Greek Fire'. Although we know of its existence, its origins are shadowy and the ingredients from which this deadly substance was made have been completely lost to history. Greek fire was a mix of liquid chemicals that could be siphoned from a cauldron, sprayed through a tube and then ignited. It was capable of clinging fast to any material and could burn through the flesh of a man in seconds. The flames were seemingly inexhaustible, and its victims had little hope of putting them out as dousing with water was futile. Contemporary sources tell us that the substance was even able to burn in water and that there were very few substances that could quench it, including sand, vinegar and, bizarrely, old urine. Greek fire was able to burn both on and under water, making it a highly-effective naval weapon, but one which could easily get out of control and destroy its users. Those brave enough to try could create a sheet of flame that rapidly consumed any ships it touched.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_civil_pre_romanesque_architecture	Under the Merovingian dynasty, the Franks pioneered what is now known as the Pre-Romanesque style of architecture and art, which attempted to collate Christian and Mediterranean styles of architecture into a new type of design. Most of the architectural efforts of the Pre-Romanesque period are exemplified by churches and basilicas, whose numbers increased dramatically during the Merovingian period. The monastery at Lorsch, Germany, is a good example of this style, with a stout, steep-roofed gatehouse and arched facade and columns. The gatehouse's triple-arched entrance is an evolution of Pre-Romanesque styles adopted by the later Carolingians as they added Roman features to the existing architectural model. This is also evidenced by the original Palatine Chapel at Charlemagne's Palace of Aachen. Although the original chapel no longer exists, it was reconstructed according to original designs, with an octagonal dome at the centre, over the cloister-vault. Charlemagne's body was interred at the chapel, but unfortunately his body was moved more than once during Medieval times and its location is no longer known.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_church_music	The music of the Christian Church, an essential part of its ceremony, comes from its Jewish forebears, as indeed do many of its rituals and rites. Although debated by scholars, some think the Psalms - integral parts of the Jewish faith - are the origin of both Jewish and Catholic religious song. However, in the middle of the 1st century AD, singing was frowned upon until the development of the church organ in approximately the 7th century, not long after the introduction of the Gregorian chant. Although commonly thought to be a Carolingian invention; a melding together of Roman and Gallic chants, legend attributes it to Pope St. Gregory the Great. Gregorian chant is known for its melisma - the singing of a single syllable over several musical notes - and its characteristic fluctuating melody. In the Middle Ages, singers were urged to extol the virtues of restraint and piety, as befit the message of the Church at that time. This is in opposition to modern Gregorian chants, which are primarily used for mood-setting and atmospherics, particularly when sung with a full choir.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_military_fyrd_levy	When the Anglo-Saxon Mercian kings went to war, they called their bannermen to fight with them. Whilst there would be a retinue of thegns to form an elite guard, the bulk of their armies had to come from elsewhere. The common folk of the country, known as the 'fyrd', were the answer. Levying freemen was a tradition from the Mercian's Germanic roots that had endured, and the fyrd fought if not for their king then for their home. Originally, all able-bodied freemen were expected to fight but it quickly became evident that whilst away from their homes, nobody could tend to crops or push the economy along, especially if a war became protracted. Likewise, if too many men died, there would be nobody to work the land when the war was over. From this, the Anglo-Saxons developed the 'select' system, where only certain men - those considered most able for the purpose - would be drafted into the army, whilst the rest would remain and see to the business of keeping the country, not just the army, going for the duration of hostilities.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_heavy_cavalry_tactics	As the Roman Empire divided and struggled into late antiquity, one of the chief problems its army had to address was its cavalry, which was greatly inferior compared to that of its enemies. The Hunnic and barbarian hordes that swept down from the steppes did so on horseback, and to the east the Sassanid armies smashed their foes apart with decisive heavy cataphracts. Rome was slow to adapt to the changing face of mounted warfare, as their chief allies primarily fielded foot soldiers. The Eastern Roman Empire, particularly, developed the clibinarii based on the eastern cataphracts, as a response to the threat posed by the unstoppable Sassanid charge. There is some debate amongst historians as to when cavalry achieved superiority over infantry, beginning the paradigm shift leading to the eventual rise of mounted knights and their dominance of the battlefield. Many believe it started at the Battle of Adrianople when the power of the Gothic heavy cavalry swept the Romans' heavy infantry from the field. However, many centuries passed before the medieval knights' spectacular war-winning combination of heavy horse and armour became the norm. 	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_maintenance_of_order	The Roman Empire was a vast, sprawling array of territories either directly controlled by the state or semi-autonomously governed and promising support and tribute. Whilst some of these could be trusted to act in accordance with Imperial demands, there were some who never truly accepted Roman dominion. The Gauls, as well as the Celtiberians, were two such groups who remained almost perennially belligerent towards their overlords. Further away, in Arabia, there is evidence that limitanei forces were stationed far away from main trade routes and frontiers, which implies they were sent to keep order, much like the occupying forces of Gaul once were. Imperial military presence in unruly settlements helped to maintain order, and keep trade and production moving where it might otherwise stagnate.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_improved_incendiary_warfare	The history of warfare in the Roman age is incredibly well documented so we are able to build a clear and concise picture of the battles they fought, and the weapons and techniques they used. Yet there is one weapon that remains a mystery, 'Greek Fire'. Although we know of its existence, its origins are shadowy and the ingredients from which this deadly substance was made have been completely lost to history. Greek fire was a mix of liquid chemicals that could be siphoned from a cauldron, sprayed through a tube and then ignited. It was capable of clinging fast to any material and could burn through the flesh of a man in seconds. The flames were seemingly inexhaustible, and its victims had little hope of putting them out as dousing with water was futile. Contemporary sources tell us that the substance was even able to burn in water and that there were very few substances that could quench it, including sand, vinegar and, bizarrely, old urine. Greek fire was able to burn both on and under water, making it a highly-effective naval weapon, but one which could easily get out of control and destroy its users. Those brave enough to try could create a sheet of flame that rapidly consumed any ships it touched.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_army_drills_visigothic	Although many barbarian peoples favoured ambush and shock tactics, there were some who developed techniques especially for use in pitched battles. The Germans, for instance, favoured columns, and when warriors from different tribes fought together each tribe formed its own column. This not only allowed them to fight in their own styles - using their own chants and war dances - but created rivalry on the battlefield, encouraging warriors to prove their fighting prowess to their neighbours. At the Battle of Pollentia the Visigoths displayed their tactical prowess by using cavalry to cut off the Roman retreat, whilst their infantry trapped the Emperor Honorius by preventing his withdrawal into the capital he was attempting to flee. This level of co-ordination could not have been achieved without extensive drilling of their forces, something which must’ve seemed entirely alien to them at the time.	true
technologies_long_description_bel_roman_military_weapon_manufactories	The Roman army changed many of its organisational and logistical systems during late antiquity. For the first time since the early Republic, an annual conscription was placed on the populace. The increased drafting of tribal warriors also meant a better template for Imperial military operations was required. Evidence suggests that a standardisation of equipment and weaponry took place, due to the existence of fabricae (factories) built inside army bases and at remote frontier stations. In the navy, also, the emphasis was placed on limited, standardised ships and formations to better suit its task of policing and protecting trade in disputed waters.	true

In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_pagan_rituals	The practice of ritualistic animal sacrifice was prevalent throughout the tribes of the ancient world. Performed as a way to offer tribute to the gods, the bodies of those animals deemed most appropriate were given up to the deity. Bulls and boars were often linked to warriors and the aristocracy, and played an important role in the mythology of the tribes, especially the Celts. The manner of sacrifice differed from tribe to tribe. There is written evidence from the Byzantine historian, Agathias of Myrina, that the Alamans decapitated their sacrifices, whereas others were thought to hang their offerings from sacred trees, allowing the blood to soak back in to the earth. 	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_call_arms	If the collapse of the Roman Empire made one thing clear, it was that life would never – could never – be the same as it had been for centuries prior. The barbarian kingdoms that swept away Rome's remnants assumed much of its workable infrastructure, particularly that relating to the organisation of the armed forces. By offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, loyalty could be secured. The kingdoms of the late Dark and early Middle Ages were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to aspire to. Members were obligated to fight for the king and provide troops from their own retinues whenever he called them to do so. In return, they were given lands and titles under the proviso that they enforced the king's laws and offered protection to the peasants who worked their lands. In real terms, this was a license to behave in almost any way the vassals liked - they had the weapons and the training to make any point they so chose; the serfs, on the other hand, had none of those things, and therefore no chance to rise up and change their situation.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_state_construction_programme	Construction programmes of great magnitude marked Roman civilisation as surely as their conquests across Europe did. Patronage from Emperors resulted in buildings being erected for the arts and religion. In late antiquity, they mainly arose from Roman Christianity, and the transformation of Constantinople into an 'invincible' Roman capital. Over the course of many Emperors, the walls of the city were expanded and reinforced until finally consisting of an outer wall, an inner wall and numerous internal fortifications, all bristling with defences. The walls of Constantinople constituted one of the greatest defensive works of the time, and the last great fortification of antiquity. The monuments, defensive fortifications, and other city constructions were financed by a combination of state money and local funds, as administration of each zone was the responsibility of either the provincial governor for public works or of the military officials for fortifications. The advent of Christianity saw the blossoming of state-sponsored churches across the entire Empire, and none more so than in Constantinople, where 33 churches were raised during the reign of Justinian alone, including what would later go on to become the Hagia Sophia. Built upon and expanded over time, it became an illustrious example of late Roman architecture, and one of the most important buildings in the world.	true

Gone were the days when they could rely heavily on ambush tactics and the headlong charge, now they were far more likely to be involved in sieges and pitched battles on terrain they were unaccustomed to. Some, like the Vandals, even fought at sea.

technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_billeting	When Belisarius’ Roman army invaded Italy in AD535, the Ostrogoths reintroduced the billeting of troops in private homes via the law of ‘hospitalitas’ – literally ‘hospitality’ – ordered the provision of shelter for billeted troops. Roman landowners were made to give up space to house a Gothic soldier in return for tax subsidies. To finance the move, the tax of ‘illatio tertiarum’ was paid by those who didn’t – the price for the relative freedom and financial prosperity many Romans enjoyed in Ostrogothic Italy. The tax was proportionally a third of all collected revenues, the idea being that it compensated participating landowners for the inconvenience of billeting and paid for the Goths’ day to day living. Another system employed to pay for billeting during the Gothic War was ‘millenarius’, a unit of assessed tax paid directly to the Gothic soldier in addition to largesse he received from the king. Naturally, no system runs perfectly, and as such there are records of disputes between billeter and billetee, as some Goths tried to convert their salaries into stakes in the land they now occupied.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_logistics	An army can live off the land in most places. What can’t be found, stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried. This meant arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load, medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable, as opposed to just plain miserable. Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or exhausted. He will not give his best in such circumstances, no matter how inspiring the leadership qualities of his commanders.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_money_control	To the more pagan, some would say 'primitive', nations of Europe, the concept of money was far more fluid than was the case in the western, Christian kingdoms. Whilst coins were used, they were not valued as highly as goods themselves, which were often bartered or traded like for like. However, if you needed a cow, for instance, but had nothing to exchange, then precious metals and what was known as hacksilver (bits and pieces of random and broken silver regarded to be as good as bullion), could be traded instead. Many Viking treasure hordes found over the years have revealed stores of hacksilver. This is probably because silver was extremely valuable and therefore could only be traded for the most precious and desirable of commodities (large animals, parcels of land, etc.). As the Vikings came into contact with other nations, such as the Franks and Anglo-Saxons, they were exposed to minted coins for the first time and saw the propaganda value of controlling the flow of money and stamping the king's head upon each and every coin.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_west_civil_new_aristocracy	As many former ‘barbarian’ peoples had been brought under Rome’s yolk during the Republican and early Imperial years, Germanic soldiers had served directly in the Roman army for several centuries. Over time, many rose to be Senators and high-ranking administrators such as Magister Militum – a position which was held by several men of barbarian descent over the years. By the 4th and 5th centuries AD, the only way of distinguishing between these ‘Romanitas’ and those of ‘true blood’ was their names, indicating that they had become fully integrated into Roman society in almost every way. The net result of this was the ‘Romanisation’ of many Germanic leaders, which in turn led to a great degree of Romanisation of the barbarian kingdoms that succeeded the collapsed Western Empire from AD476. In order to cement and legitimise their rule, the barbarian successor kings sought to go further than merely adding a layer of their most prestigious people on top of existing Roman society. The Ostrogothic king, Theoderic the Great, for instance, immediately forged alliances through the marriage of his most loyal free men to the daughters of Roman nobles and those of his barbarian rivals amongst the Vandals, etc. in order that society might quickly return to a sense of normality and community, and life might go on relatively unhindered. There was an ulterior motive, however, in that Theoderic wished barbarian Europe to stand behind him against the Eastern Roman Empire and any attempts to recapture the territory lost following the West's collapse. Unfortunately, his marriage-alliance policy was only partially successful; the Visigoths were soon at war with the Franks and Theoderic's alliance with the Vandals floundered after the death of Thrasamund, a fellow Arian Christian and enemy of Constantinople.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_royal_minting	Although the first mints appeared as early as the 7th century BC and spread swiftly around the ancient world, the concept of using coins to define value wasn't adopted by the northern tribes until much later. Prior to the 2nd century BC, bartering and payment-in-kind were widely-used by various tribes and petty kingdoms; the concept of an alternative to treasure that could be accumulated to obtain wealth was alien to the barbarian mindset. Although coins were used by the Celts from that point onwards, the first Germanic ruler to mint in his own name, and bearing his image, was Rechiar, who was king of the Suebi during the 3rd century AD. However, he had other motives aside from the stimulation of the economy, seeing minting, rightly, as a form of propaganda with which to consolidate his powerbase. Once the Vandals and Visigoths occupied former Roman territory they took over much of the ailing Empire's infrastructure, and as such began minting coins from the late 5th century onwards. At first they simply continued to mint 'pseudo-Imperial' coinage such as the 'tremissis' and 'solidus', but eventually reformed the system and produced independent currency using classic designs. Some mints even appropriated Imperial iconography, something that was undoubtedly shocking to their contemporaries but served as a blatant declaration of intent to rule in the Empire's stead.	true

Hauberks were constructed of metal rings, linked together to provide defence by forming a mesh of protective metal, whilst still being flexible and allowing the wearer to move with relative freedom, especially compared to plate mail. Hauberks were distinct in that they dropped down to the mid-thigh, with the length of the arm often varying between full length and just above the elbow. A variant of the hauberk, called the 'haubergeon' ('little hauberk'), rested around the waist and was shorter in the arms. These were often used by Islamic armies, particularly those stationed in Al-Andalus.	true

Eastern armies, for example, were created by command of the king, who ordered his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place.

In the capitulary, Charlemagne requests that "boys may be taught in the Psalms, the system of musical notation, singing, arithmetic and grammar", and that the Church was to "exact no price" for this education.

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_certificates_and_seals	Trade between China and the eastern kingdoms was extremely important to the Persian, Arabian, and Aksumite economies. There were three main routes along this “Silk Road” from the Far East: the northern route, which passed through Persia to the Levant and was the source of much Sassanid wealth; the southern route, which involved negotiating the Karakoram mountains, through the Hindu Kush and into Baktria before heading west; the southwestern route, which went down through India before switching to ships (in order to avoid the scorching, inhospitable Arabian desert), sailing around the Horn of Africa and up into the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. This meant that even places such as Himyar and Aksum gained access to Chinese goods, and led to the exchange of cultural ideas and religious beliefs between China, African and Arabia – Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and Buddhism all spread across the Eurasian world in this manner. Of course, it was imperative that the route itself remain open as long as possible, so much effort was expended to keep it free of banditry and ensure that travellers along it were able to get fresh provisions, somewhere to stay, and most of all remained alive for the duration of their highly lucrative journeys.   	true

This addition to the Muslim roster was beneficial at a time when their cavalry forces were faltering by comparison with those of other armies of the period. These Iberian men rode in a much less 'civilised' manner than their European counterparts, using basic saddles and stirrups, yet the zeal and fervour they showed in battle more than made up for any technical deficiencies they may have had.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_unified_state_administration	Over time, the Sassanids reformed many institutions so that more of the empire could be controlled by a central authority. In the beginning, however, the monarchy operated similarly to its Parthian predecessors, with satraps being almost independent kingdoms that fed support back into the state. Ardashir I began building new 'royal' cities and renaming old ones, creating territories that were loyal to the Shahanshah and not to over-powerful nobles. He was able to place his own men and labour forces in these cities, creating a loyal populace. Although they were still semi-independent, royal cities were nevertheless unified by state administration, and not reliant on the whims of noble and minor kings. There is evidence that the newly settled people were apportioned a division of land, as evidenced by a Sassanid deputy, vested with authority over Dura, owning an estate just outside the city. Despite this increase in central state control, the Shahanshah continued  to promote the policy of religious tolerance instituted by the Parthians whilst championing Zoroastrianism as the official state religion at the same time. This religious tolerance was borne out in the royal cities, where the majority of the artisan class (masons, woodworkers, stone cutters, etc.) were Christian. These artisans, unless in a royal workshop, belonged to private 'corporations', which worked much like early guilds or unions. Artisans, particularly Christian ones, were able obtain exemption from military service as a perk of their craft. This was not a boon granted to the peasantry, who were levied wholesale to fight in the Shahanshah's wars.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_military_manouvers_ostrogothic	Following Hunnic invasions of many barbarian territories, and the mass migrations that followed, tribes were forced to adopt new military tactics in order to survive. Gone were the days when they could rely heavily on ambush tactics and the headlong charge, now they were far more likely to be involved in sieges and pitched battles on terrain they were unaccustomed to. Some, like the Vandals, even fought at sea. This made them the first tribe to possess a fleet in the Mediterranean; one that would go on to enable their conquest of much of the region, defeating several seasoned Roman naval commanders along the way. 	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_long_lease_contracts	Rome, since the early days of Empire, granted leases to landowners for them to control packets of land, usually on long-term contracts or perpetually, with the proviso that they paid an annual rent back to the state. This was done originally for agricultural purposes but later also for property development. Although initially a state legislature, the late Empire saw the rights of 'emphyteusis and superficies', whereby a private landowner could rent out land to others. As the Empire passed into late antiquity, the law of emphyteusis became more and more prevalent, with 'posessio ad tempus locata' (long-lease contracts) replacing the 'locatio-conductio' (short term ones). The system of emphyteusis still exists today, though in an altered form. 	true

technologies_long_description_att_slav_civil_elite_dominance_sclaveni	'Elite Theory' is a sociological paradigm that exists as strongly today as in antiquity. By its most basic definition, the theory proposes that the powerful and the wealthy - the 'elite' - form a ruling minority in society, responsible for all the decision-making within their social structure. In contemporary society, these are generally issues of economic and political direction, but during antiquity this dominance would have had much greater influence – which gods were worshipped, for instance, all the way down to how people spoke and which words were used. The culture of entire tribes, as well as their linguistic development, could be altered by a relative minority. For instance, if a ruling elite used a different language to the 'lesser' majority, it is conceivable that their cultural and linguistic preferences would be imprinted upon the rest of the population, forcing a slow but gradual shift in their societal development.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_military_select_fyrd	When the Anglo-Saxon Mercian kings went to war, they called their bannermen to fight with them. Whilst there would be a retinue of thegns to form an elite guard, the bulk of their armies had to come from elsewhere. The common folk of the country, known as the 'fyrd', were the answer. Levying freemen was a tradition from the Mercian's Germanic roots that had endured, and the fyrd fought if not for their king then for their home. Originally, all able-bodied freemen were expected to fight but it quickly became evident that whilst away from their homes, nobody could tend to crops or push the economy along, especially if a war became protracted. Likewise, if too many men died, there would be nobody to work the land when the war was over. From this, the Anglo-Saxons developed the 'select' system, where only certain men - those considered most able for the purpose - would be drafted into the army, whilst the rest would remain and see to the business of keeping the country, not just the army, going for the duration of hostilities.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_roman_military_billeting	Billeting is the practice of housing troops in privately-owned property. For the Roman army this type of accommodation was known as ‘hospitalitas’, from which we get ‘hospitality’. The troops were given one third of their billet's living space and their rations were provided by the provincial authorities, not their hosts. Troops would know which house they were assigned to because their names would be carved on its door post. Billeting troops became a common occurrence in the 4th and 5th century AD as the Western Romans needed to ensure its troops could quickly reach problem areas in their rapidly deteriorating Empire. The limitanei, or frontier units, were well used to maintaining and defending positions over long periods. Compared to the comitatenses, they were static and entrenched within local populaces. Limitanei were even assigned lands in some provinces and conducted maintenance when they weren't fighting. As such, limes became desirable residences, highlighting how easy it was to exploit troop privileges. The mobile field armies of comitatenses were less static and so were often billeted in cities when on campaign. This, again, provided ample opportunity for exploitation and corruption; the most desirable properties and fertile lands were conveniently appropriated by the army to meet the comitatenses’ needs.	true
technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_militarised_society	Germanic soldiers had served directly in the Roman army for several centuries. Over time, many rose to be Senators and high-ranking administrators such as Magister Militum – a position which was held by several men of barbarian descent over the years. By the 4th and 5th centuries AD, the only way of distinguishing between these ‘Romanitas’ and those of ‘true blood’ was their names, indicating that they had become fully integrated into Roman society in almost every way. Whilst both the Eastern and Western Roman Empires deployed their armies along the same organisational lines, as time progressed the West became a more militarised society. The rise of 'ethnic' identity, as opposed to 'biological' identity, became the basis of recruitment there. As a result, barbarian culture bled across the divide, and the social status of a warrior was raised once again as civil and military lines blurred and the facade of a purely 'Roman' Empire began to crumble. The net result of this was the ‘Romanisation’ of many Germanic leaders, which in turn led to a great degree of Romanisation of the barbarian kingdoms that succeeded the collapsed Western Empire from AD476, as Romans of barbarian descent found themselves with the right bloodlines to occupy powerful positions within the new kingdoms. 	true

By offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, loyalty could be secured. The kingdoms of the late Dark and early Middle Ages were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to aspire to. Members were obligated to fight for the king and provide troops from their own retinues whenever he called them to do so. In return, they were given lands and titles under the proviso that they enforced the king's laws and offered protection to the peasants who worked their lands.

At the peak of their power they were the epitome of everything that turned steppe nomads into effective cavalrymen. No-one was their equal in the saddle. 'Civilised' writers criticised them for being 'barbarous' and cruel, but were perfectly willing to employ them for their barbarous skills.

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_civil_bronze_casting	'Lost-wax casting' - or 'bronze casting' - dates back thousands of years, its methodology remaining relatively unchanged in that time. The process creates metal (usually bronze) duplicates of sculptures by creating an outer mould of the original sculpture in wax or sometimes clay. Molten wax is then poured in until the shape is defined, forming the inner mould. This is then allowed to cool and set before molten metal (bronze) is poured in and the copy created. Usually, after the process is completed the wax shell is discarded, though in some cases it is retained for further use. The bronze-casting method was so ancient that Pliny spoke of it in his writings, and it was used in ancient India too, according to the Shilpa Shastras texts. As the Medieval age dawned, it was further used by Benedictine Monks such as the noted metalworker and goldsmith Roger of Helmarshausen.	true

Alcuin became Charlemagne's 'prime minister of education' and held sway in all scholastic matters for the entire realm, as well as personally tutoring the king.

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_army_drills_ostrogothic	Although many barbarian peoples favoured ambush and shock tactics, there were some who developed techniques especially for use in pitched battles. The Germans, for instance, favoured columns, and when warriors from different tribes fought together each tribe formed its own column. This not only allowed them to fight in their own styles - using their own chants and war dances - but created rivalry on the battlefield, encouraging warriors to prove their fighting prowess to their neighbours. At the Battle of Pollentia the Visigoths displayed their tactical prowess by using cavalry to cut off the Roman retreat, whilst their infantry trapped the Emperor Honorius by preventing his withdrawal into the capital he was attempting to flee. This level of co-ordination could not have been achieved without extensive drilling of their forces, something which must’ve seemed entirely alien to them at the time.	true

By the time of Justinian, however, Imperial bureaucrats were much more powerful, holding jurisdiction over revenue-gathering and even dispatched to oversee that military expeditions remained on or close to their agreed budget. Logothetes were paid an allowance of twelve percent of each piece of revenue they gathered in the Empire's name - something that ensured many of them became extremely wealthy.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_martial_culture	Battle was an integral part of the various barbarian cultures of antiquity. Tribes of all ethnicities fought the neighbouring Celts, Germans, Slavs, Norsemen, Greeks, nomads and, above all others, the expansionist, imperialist Romans. Amongst themselves, tribes fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class or two nominated champions facing off in single combat. For the would-be warrior, displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids once they had reached manhood. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true

Charlemagne formalised this work, making it central a central tenet of their duty to their congregations.

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_martial_culture_alani	Nomadic tribes were moulded by their living conditions, the vast steppes making them excellent horsemen with a predominantly martial culture. As a result, they relied heavily on their horses for both war and transport and treated them with reverence. The nomadic warrior spent most of his time on horseback, and had to learn the lance, composite bow, and melee weapons – all whilst riding at breakneck speed and often wearing cumbersome scale armour. Once learned, these impressive martial skills were honed during the lightning raids, usually on weaker, settled peoples, that ensured the tribe got whatever it needed to flourish. As horses were an essential part of their everyday lives, and indeed the thing on which their entire culture depended, the needs of those animals were paramount. 	true
technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_military_regimentation_of_military_equipment	Eventually, the desert kingdoms evolved from tribal confederations to well-organised societies, with the military might to ensure their survival. Kingdoms such as the Lakhmids and the African Aksumites drew elements from their lesser nobility to form core standing armies, based at the capital, whose prime directive was to protect the king – and by extension, the kingdom – from both external threats and internal insurrection. Naturally, under such circumstances, it was no longer feasible to expect soldiers to provide their own equipment, so armour and weapons of a uniform style were produced, and to the highest standards of quality. This had the added benefit of giving armies a ‘look’ of their own, making them recognisable to the enemy at a distance – something that could induce fear and reduce morale before the first blow was even struck.	true

The habitus extolled the virtues of loyalty, mercy, strength, generosity and honour as key facets of the nobility. Many of its ideals were first postulated in the Song of Roland, an epic poem written about the decisive Battle of Roncevaux in AD778, when Charlemagne's rear guard were cut off and bravely fought to the last man to ensure their king's escape.

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_irrigation_techniques	Agriculture was - and remains - a difficult endeavour. Water is the crucial factor: rivers and flood plains might be good for growing crops, but a flood can wash away good soil instead of renewing the land. In more arid areas, farmers are reliant on canals and qanats for irrigation, and water must be managed carefully. Basic irrigation systems were widespread in the ancient world because they were simple to maintain. Perennial irrigation was rarer, and required longer canal systems, a method of storage, and better maintenance to ensure that silt and salt build-up was kept in check. For example, in sun-scorched Mesopotamia the river system was able to supply water to the surrounding arable land in the dry season through a system of canals, closed off by dykes and sluice gates. Water was stored in reservoirs, either natural or man-made, and then lifted into the irrigation channels. While this was a labour-intensive task, the results of such toil were remarkable and hugely beneficial to harvests in the area.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_civil_land_grants	In order to cement and legitimise their rule, the former 'barbarian' kingdoms sought to go further than merely adding a layer of their most prestigious people on top of the old Roman societal infrastructure. Alliances were forged and loyalty secured through intermarriage between ruling houses, a practice which continued right up to the modern age. Another way of maintaining stability was to 'buy' allegiances via the gifting of strategically-positioned territories, thus ensuring that potential rivals were placated and, rather more cynically, so 'buffer' states existed between the giver and any hostile powers. Initially all this was designed in order to present a united front against the Byzantine Romans – who would surely come to reclaim their former Empire in the west – but eventually was just a way of keeping the emergent royal houses in control of their kingdoms.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_military_siege_techniques	The established norms of siege warfare changed during the Middle Ages. The same general principles of starvation and destruction applied, but as cities became larger and more fortified, the method of cracking these increasingly daunting defences also had to adapt. The onager and ballista were still common sights in a siege engineer's arsenal, but so too were newer, more adventurous weapons like the trebuchet and mangonel. Enormous, beam-sling weapons that hurled rocks (or whatever the general chose - even enemy prisoners!) in gigantic arcs before releasing them, created enormous amounts of force with which the attacker hoped to smash down walls or fire over them to destroy the city beyond. However, not always were these weapons the key to victory - at the Siege of Pavia in AD773-4, Charlemagne failed to bring siege equipment to his assault on the Lombard capital, and so the Frankish king was forced to starve the city out.

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_local_traditions	The pagan tribes of Europe fought fiercely to defend their way of life against the encroaching tide of Christianity proselytised by the Byzantines and Charlemagne. They continued to practice votive offerings, depositing items at sacred places to gain the grace of the gods, or to ask favours of them, even vengeance. Pagans worshipped the natural world and the spirits of the land, with whom they tried to communicate by casting offerings into the water or burying them for the earth to claim. Even upon their grudging conversion to Christianity, in the late first century, peoples such as the Saxons continued to practice paganism, using gold and precious substances to gain the favour of the One God, or perhaps more duplicitously to appear as if that was the case.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_civil_insular_art	In the British Isles, a distinct style of manuscript art emerged, called 'insular' art, from the Latin 'insula' (island). Insular art is much more dense and imaginative than illuminations from the continent, with spirals and complicated geometric shapes appearing - possibly due to Celtic influences. The Germanic influence and traditions of the Anglo-Saxons also saw pagan motifs - animals and nature - featuring heavily. The Book of Kells, an Irish version of the Bible from approximately AD800, is one of the most intricately decorated examples of insular art to have survived to the present day, with entire pages of vibrant colours, intricate shapes and complicated patternwork.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_system_of_tactics	The traditional military system of the Roman Empire, at its core, endured throughout its history. From the rise of the Republic, the reforms of Marius and the ascent of Roman Imperialism, the central tenets of its strategy survived. In particular, the backbone of heavy legionary infantry was a staple of the army far into late antiquity, remaining the cornerstone of its strategies in defining battles such as Strasbourg and Adrianople. These battles stood to highlight, however, that not all facets of Roman operational strategy were sustainable in the changing military climate. During Adrianople, the superior Gothic cavalry was able to rout the Roman horsemen and then envelop their infantry, which was pinned down in the marshy terrain. Contact with the Sassanid Empire, furthermore, highlighted that Roman strategy of infantry columns was not tenable in the harsher eastern climes. Roman forces found themselves outmanoeuvred by Sassanid cavalry and archers. Particularly in the east, the military paradigm had changed, and although the core of their traditions remained unbowed, the rise of Roman clibinarii and catafractarii showed their determination to meet head-on the rising threats of the changing world.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_siege_techniques	The established norms of siege warfare changed during the Middle Ages. The same general principles of starvation and destruction applied, but as cities became larger and more fortified, the method of cracking these increasingly daunting defences also had to adapt. The onager and ballista were still common sights in a siege engineer's arsenal, but so too were newer, more adventurous weapons like the trebuchet and mangonel. Enormous, beam-sling weapons that hurled rocks (or whatever the general chose - even enemy prisoners!) in gigantic arcs before releasing them, created enormous amounts of force with which the attacker hoped to smash down walls or fire over them to destroy the city beyond. However, not always were these weapons the key to victory - at the Siege of Pavia in AD773-4, Charlemagne failed to bring siege equipment to his assault on the Lombard capital, and so the Frankish king was forced to starve the city out.

The Alans, whose migration as part of the Vandal horde took them as far as Africa, settled several times, many choosing not to continue the journey on each occasion. A powerful contingent of Alanic cavalry, for instance, chose to remain in Armorica (now in north-western France). Over the years, the Alans were able to pass on much of their fighting knowledge to the peoples with whom they travelled. Excellent cavalrymen in the nomadic tradition, they could control their mounts with their knees whilst fighting at the same time. The Alans were highly proficient in both archery and the use of the deadly kontos long-lance from horseback, and the scale armour they wore was made from thin strips of horn or metal, allowing them to run down opponents whilst under heavy fire. The Vandal army that fought Belisarius featured a large contingent of Alan-influenced cavalry.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_military_tactical_formations	The word ‘horde’ conjures images of disarray and chaos, but a Hun attack was far more than a mad charge by crazed barbarians. The Roman historian and solider, Ammianus Marcellinus gave his account of this fearsome sight, stating that: “they enter the battle in tactical formation”. He also described how the lightly-equipped Huns were able to divide suddenly, performing swift, unexpected movements that the Romans were unable to adequately counter. His detailed description also covers the Huns shouting curses to startle and disorientate their enemies, their impressive ability at-range and in hand-to-hand combat, and their use of cloth nooses to disable mounted enemies.	true
technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_royal_judgement	Power always was a fickle partner, and no less so in antiquity. The warrior-led societies of ancient Europe were based primarily on the strength of the individual. Much like Attila's empire in the east, western barbarian kingdoms were held together by the passion and power of their leader. A weak man could be toppled by stronger claimants to his throne. However, there were several ways a leader could maintain power. Victory in battle could help ensure he was feared and respected in equal measure; a man who gained glory on the battlefield was more likely to keep the support of his people. A ruler battered by military defeats would be seen as weak and, more importantly, vulnerable to usurpation by a stronger claimant. Power through law and religion was another way to gain and maintain strength. If the king was also the arbiter in all matters - even meting out 'divine justice' then his power extended to the lowest man, helping to reinforce his position further. Of course, loyalty could also be bought with cold, hard bribery; the distribution of prestigious gifts guaranteed the dedication of subordinate chiefs, at least temporarily. There is even evidence of industries dedicated to the production of prestige items, primarily for barbarian kings to purchase loyalty. Of particular value were those items of Roman design, which linked their owners to the resplendence of Imperial Rome.	true

Not surprisingly these new ideas were not welcomed by all, and some were persecuted for their corrupting influence. Socrates was sentenced to death by an Athenian jury, but his work inspired Plato who went on to create a school of thought that changed governmental practices and, for the first time, addressed the welfare of society as a whole.	true

The latter is certainly true of the Huns; the wide variety of writings created by the Romans explain the origins of these invading ‘barbarians’ and tell us more about Roman fear than anything else. So what did the Romans believe? Some accounts state that the Huns followed a deer across the Cimmerian Straits - an idea borrowed from ancient Greek myth that is still part of Hungarian legends to this day - whereas others, somewhat less plausibly, claimed that the Huns were in fact descended from fallen angels and witches. 	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_regional_exchange	The Eastern Roman Empire, at its peak, covered roughly 1.3 million square kilometres. The diversity of climates spanning the vast Imperial holdings ranged from Mediterranean warmth to frigid Balkan forestry, and with this came a wide variety of agricultural output. Wheat was the primary crop, being grown across the majority of the Empire, but also barley, rye and oats - especially in more northern, arid locales. Luxury items, such as olives and wine, were the key financial crops and brought in the most money. The discovery of numerous, tiny pockets of soil in the Syrian massif regions is indicative of a specialised industry there, dedicated to the cultivation and production of olives, much like the specialist vineyards scattered across the Empire. The diversity of the crops grown was used both internally and externally, sustaining both Rome and her people as well as being transported, when possible, to trading partners. As well as Empire-wide and international distribution, evidence suggests that the Near East was also a hub for prosperous local trade; the discovery of coins and pottery across the area attest to this, as does the economic survival of the region far beyond that of more distant Imperial acquisitions, such as Britannia.	true

technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_4_pagan_himyar	The Mesopotamian pantheon is arguably the oldest religion in the world, and definitely the first to be codified. It was one of the most densely populated, with evidence of more than two thousand gods who watched over every aspect of human life. This vast religion was far-reaching in its influence; even the Arabian tribes, far to the south, worshipped Mesopotamian gods who, although slightly altered in their aspects and purposes, remained essentially the same deities. One such example is Athtar, the Semitic god of war and the morning star. He was worshipped throughout Arabia as Ishtar - also the name of the Mesopotamian goddess of fertility and war. Athtar was worshipped with flames; temples to the god contained an open pit with a fire burning in the centre. This connects Ishtar to Zoroastrianism, which has a concept of holy fire known as 'atar', illustrating just how far the influence of the old gods reaches.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_water_power	Before the advent of industrial mechanisation and electric power, harnessing the power of flowing water was the most effective method of generating energy for industry and agriculture. Water wheels and mills were known to have been used throughout ancient Rome and India, whereby the flow of a river (or, in Medieval times, the tide) turns gears and belts to generate power for irrigation. A process known as 'hushing' was developed during the 1st century AD and had been widely adopted by the dawn of the Middle Ages. Hushing is the deliberate and targeted use of torrents of water to wash away layers of soil and debris around seams so that they could be mined, with a sluice gate opened to control the strength of the water flow. In an era before explosives, hushing was an excellent method of revealing the minerals and wealth of the earth - and is still used to some extent in cases where explosives are deemed too destructive to the area being mined.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_military_restored_persian_military_organisation	The predecessors of the Sassanids, the Parthians, had almost no standing army, instead recruiting troops from satraps as and when required for local crises or wars. When Ardashir I seized the throne of Ctesiphon and House Sassan ascended, he aimed at a revival of the bygone Achaemenid Persian Empire. To this end, he restructured the military, creating a standing army under his personal command with a system of officers and regiments that answered to him, as opposed to his client kingdoms, as in the case of Parthia. However, he retained the Parthian cavalry model because the cataphracts brought his predecessors success in the field.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_militia	In their original form, militias were simply warriors who adhered to the principles of combat. However, over time they evolved from their Roman roots to mean part-time military forces used for the defence of cities or towns. Before the centralisation of government and the military in the later Middle Ages, noblemen from individual provinces were responsible for fielding troops during wartime, and also the militias that remained behind. The Emirate armies of Cordoba relied on Berber and Andalusian natives for their militias - the veterans of the Syrian garrisons were better suited to forming the core of the emir's standing armies. The Anglo-Saxon system of 'fyrd' and 'select' recruitment perfectly encapsulates the notion of armies and militias during this period - those who did not get drafted into the army to fight their king's wars stayed behind to make their villages safe. Redoubts were strengthened, militias formed, and barricades erected so settlements were fully prepared should the war come to them.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_christ_civil_chronicles	As the most studied and referenced book in the age, the Bible was dutifully and exquisitely transcribed in Latin by the monastic orders, in a manner befitting the word of God. One of the most famous manuscripts of the era is the Utrecht Psalter, an exquisite and vibrant collection of ink illustrations accompanying each of the Psalms and one of the most well-known and well-preserved examples of illumination. Also known as 'miniature', from the Latin 'minium' (red lead), used for colouring along with other pigments like vermillion. By the time of late antiquity, papyrus had fallen out of use as a writing surface in favour of the more durable and lasting parchment or vellum, which were carefully prepared before being written upon. Vellum, made from calfskin and usually used for higher-quality texts, was soaked in water and lime and left to dry for several days. Afterwards, excess hair was removed and the skin framed and pressed. Finally, the sheet of vellum was rubbed with a flat object to allow ease of writing; the vellum was then fit for purpose.	true

Equus ferus’ role was tied to its physical form – the small, early horse could only be used to pull primitive chariots. Larger, faster horses were later bred and used by skirmishers to chase down troops, but it was not until the development of more muscular breeds that shock troops such as the cataphracts came into being. Their long lances and heavy armour made these new-style heavy cavalry units deadly against infantry, fundamentally changing the nature of warfare forever. The racing of horses for sport went hand in hand with their military use, and of course provided useful training for both rider and animal.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_civil_trade_hubs	Whilst those parts of Europe inside the boundaries of the Roman Empire prospered during antiquity, due to the great roads and merchant fleets built to facilitate commerce, northern, Germanic Europe generally languished in relative isolation. This was only made worse by the movement of the Roman capital further east to Constantinople in the 4th century AD, and the great climate change that ravaged the crops and natural wealth of much of northern and eastern Europe during the Migration Period. By the 7th century AD, however, the Merovingian Frankish kings began revitalising trade in northern Europe with a fair at St. Denis, which connected cities across the northern continent, mainly via old Roman roads and the network of rivers that lattice Europe. As the climate change abated, ports and river villages began to become important trade hubs once again, and none more so than the city of Dorestad. Ideally positioned between the Franks and the Frisians, it allowed merchants a convenient half-way point to meet and do business. Its value, however, dragged it into a battle for power between the two, a conflict that widened as the Middle Ages progressed, ultimately leading to the downfall of Dorestad as a major trading city.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_stirrup	Although the horse was always a valuable tool in pre-industrialised warfare, it was not until the development of the stirrup that cavalry truly became a properly versatile battlefield force. Although stirrups were first used by the Assyrians in approximately 700BC, they were rudimentary cloth pads that provided no real stability for the rider. It was the Sarmatians that developed the single stirrup, much similar to the device we now know, during the 1st century BC, but it wasn't until the 5th century AD that it began to spread to western Europe. As the Avars migrated across the continent, they brought their impressive nomad cavalry technology with them. Stirrups enabled a rider more stability atop his horse, especially in conjunction with developments in saddle technology; the pommel saddle giving more rigid support and allowing riders to control their horses whilst wielding weapons at the same time. With support beneath from a sturdy saddle and with well-developed stirrups, the horseman was both master of his steed and master of the battlefield.	true

As well as caravanserai - lodgehouses and inns where weary traders could rest - the Sassanids also set up fortresses and outposts along the road to deter bandits and robbers from attempting to loot the caravans.

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_army_drills	Although many barbarian peoples favoured ambush and shock tactics, there were some who developed techniques especially for use in pitched battles. The Germans, for instance, favoured columns, and when warriors from different tribes fought together each tribe formed its own column. This not only allowed them to fight in their own styles - using their own chants and war dances - but created rivalry on the battlefield, encouraging warriors to prove their fighting prowess to their neighbours. At the Battle of Pollentia the Visigoths displayed their tactical prowess by using cavalry to cut off the Roman retreat, whilst their infantry trapped the Emperor Honorius by preventing his withdrawal into the capital he was attempting to flee. This level of co-ordination could not have been achieved without extensive drilling of their forces, something which must’ve seemed entirely alien to them at the time.	true
technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_martial_culture_ostrogothic	Battle was an integral part of the various barbarian cultures of antiquity. Tribes of all ethnicities fought the neighbouring Celts, Germans, Slavs, Norsemen, Greeks, nomads and, above all others, the expansionist, imperialist Romans. Amongst themselves, tribes fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class or two nominated champions facing off in single combat. For the would-be warrior, displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids once they had reached manhood. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true

technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_1_pagan_himyar	The zodiac calendar is a circle divided into the 12 signs, corresponding to the paths of the sun, moon and planets across the "celestial sphere". The word zodiac comes from Greek and means "circle of animals", referring to the beasts assigned to each sign - the bull, the ram, etc. Originally, the calendar was used as an ecliptic co-ordinate system, but became associated with astrology as scholars attempted to divine how the powers of the stars affected the natural world. As such, the zodiac was used to portend dark events or to explain phenomenon like natural catastrophes or rebellions. The Himyar version of this calendar differed as it was arranged in a rectangle, with the animals ascending from left to right (so Sagittarius would be to the right of Scorpio). The animals themselves have remained the same over the years, though their significance and meaning has altered somewhat.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_call_vassals	If the collapse of the Roman Empire made one thing clear, it was that life would never – could never – be the same as it had been for centuries prior. The barbarian kingdoms that swept away Rome's remnants assumed much of its workable infrastructure, particularly that relating to the organisation of the armed forces. By offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, loyalty could be secured. The kingdoms of the late Dark and early Middle Ages were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to aspire to. Members were obligated to fight for the king and provide troops from their own retinues whenever he called them to do so. In return, they were given lands and titles under the proviso that they enforced the king's laws and offered protection to the peasants who worked their lands. In real terms, this was a license to behave in almost any way the vassals liked - they had the weapons and the training to make any point they so chose; the serfs, on the other hand, had none of those things, and therefore no chance to rise up and change their situation.	true

As the Empire expanded, more and more non-native peoples were admitted - mainly from barbarian tribes. These tribes helped form the Legions, as well as providing their services as 'foederati'; Roman allied forces. Over time, particularly in the Eastern Roman Empire, barbarian troops became incorporated into the standard structure of the Roman army, as in the cases of the Vandals and Tzani. However, ad hoc conscription, 'dilectus', was still employed to create a levy of troops from the common Roman men, replete with provisions and state-provided equipment. Although more distanced from the military, the civilian populace was not quite free of military invention in their lives.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_english_civil_coinage	Charlemagne made his mark on Europe in almost every way. Shortly after assuming power, he struck his kingdom's currency, the 'livre', for the first time. A livre could be broken down into twenty 'sous' (known in the old Roman Empire as 'solidus'), which in turn consisted of twelve 'deniers' or silver pennies. The gold solidus, however, was a paper accounting unit only (that is, not physically minted, simply used for division), as the Franks adopted the silver standard and the livre itself was equal in weight to a pound of silver. The system was supposed to be standardised throughout the kingdom but a coin's value frequently differed depending on where it was minted. Despite this, the 'Livre Carolingienne', as it was known, and in particular the denier, became the basis of European currency for year to come, up to the modern age in fact, including influencing the development of the English pound and penny.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_improved_incendiary_warfare	The history of warfare in the Roman age is incredibly well documented so we are able to build a clear and concise picture of the battles they fought, and the weapons and techniques they used. Yet there is one weapon that remains a mystery, 'Greek Fire'. Although we know of its existence, its origins are shadowy and the ingredients from which this deadly substance was made have been completely lost to history. Greek fire was a mix of liquid chemicals that could be siphoned from a cauldron, sprayed through a tube and then ignited. It was capable of clinging fast to any material and could burn through the flesh of a man in seconds. The flames were seemingly inexhaustible, and its victims had little hope of putting them out as dousing with water was futile. Contemporary sources tell us that the substance was even able to burn in water and that there were very few substances that could quench it, including sand, vinegar and, bizarrely, old urine. Greek fire was able to burn both on and under water, making it a highly-effective naval weapon, but one which could easily get out of control and destroy its users. Those brave enough to try could create a sheet of flame that rapidly consumed any ships it touched.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_military_masters_terrain	One of the cornerstones of strategy is an understanding of the best place to fight a battle. Sun Tzu, in his 'Art of War', spends an entire chapter on the significance of terrain, and though he may have been unknown in the western Middle Ages, the tenets of his work are universally understood. Throughout history, examples clearly show that knowledge of the land confers innumerable benefits. The ambush at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, for instance, overwhelmed the Roman Legions as they traversed through unknown terrain, whilst the Cherusci forces under Arminius knew the topography intimately, and were able to hound the Imperial forces to complete annihilation. Likewise, the 8th century kingdoms of the northern British Isles selected the best strategic locations on which to build their defensive burhs - sites were selected that deliberately crossed paths and towns the enemy would have to traverse and capture to attain victory.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_professional_soldiers	Traditionally, the citizen armies of the Dark Ages were supplied by a combination of levies and volunteer troops.

The professional soldier was a different beast entirely; he gave his life to the army, never thinking too much about what awaited him back home. However, when a state discharged these men without suitable reward, they often turned to their generals for help. If successful in securing spoils for his men, a general could potentially exert huge influence and power.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_military_kataphractoi	The eastern kingdoms eschewed columns of infantry in favour of a dominant cavalry force able to outmanoeuvre and harass infantry on the plains of the east. Their cavalry took many forms, fielding short swordsmen, light skirmishers and archers, but the most effective weapon was the lance, particularly amongst the cataphract elite. The kontos was a wooden lance, roughly four metres in length, and was much stronger than contemporary Roman and Hellenistic lances. The term 'kataphractoi' is of Greek origin and can be interpreted as 'fully-armoured' or 'closed from all sides'. In military terms, it described heavily-armoured cavalrymen. These shock troops were first fielded as part of Darius’ army at Gaugalema in 352BC. Both rider and mount required excellent stamina, as they were completely enclosed by metal scale armour - and in desert heat too! Cataphract cavalry could use their weight and armour to penetrate an enemy line, but were far less agile than regular horsemen as a result. According to Plutarch, the strength of the lance and the power the rider put behind it meant that, purportedly, it could skewer two men at once!	true
technologies_long_description_bel_roman_military_defence_in_depth	'Defence in Depth' is a theory held amongst some historians that Roman defensive military strategy evolved in the 4th century AD from the previous ideology of 'preclusive defence'. Preclusive defence was Rome's method of neutralising incursions by stationing units along its border, as well as in forward outposts, to trap enemy forces that came between them in a pincer movement. However, Roman borders became too vast to defend properly in this manner; limitanei couldn't hope to successfully defend fortifications until comitatenses swept in from outlying regions to neutralise the threat. This led to the development of defence in depth, a technique whereby the enemy army is given some ground over a large area, weakening its supply logistics as it spreads itself too thinly. Then, its weaker positions are attacked by the defending army, with the intention of repelling the enemy back to its original position - outside the boundaries the strategy was intended to defend. Defence in depth was common in late antiquity, when Rome's Western Empire became too ungainly, and among the barbarian kingdoms that succeeded it, in order to maintain their new-found and hard-won frontiers.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_division_of_lands	Over time, the Sassanids reformed many institutions so that more of the empire could be controlled by a central authority. In the beginning, however, the monarchy operated similarly to its Parthian predecessors, with satraps being almost independent kingdoms that fed support back into the state. Ardashir I began building new 'royal' cities and renaming old ones, creating territories that were loyal to the Shahanshah and not to over-powerful nobles. He was able to place his own men and labour forces in these cities, creating a loyal populace. Although they were still semi-independent, royal cities were nevertheless unified by state administration, and not reliant on the whims of noble and minor kings. There is evidence that the newly settled people were apportioned a division of land, as evidenced by a Sassanid deputy, vested with authority over Dura, owning an estate just outside the city. Despite this increase in central state control, the Shahanshah continued  to promote the policy of religious tolerance instituted by the Parthians whilst championing Zoroastrianism as the official state religion at the same time. This religious tolerance was borne out in the royal cities, where the majority of the artisan class (masons, woodworkers, stone cutters, etc.) were Christian. These artisans, unless in a royal workshop, belonged to private 'corporations', which worked much like early guilds or unions. Artisans, particularly Christian ones, were able obtain exemption from military service as a perk of their craft. This was not a boon granted to the peasantry, who were levied wholesale to fight in the Shahanshah's wars.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_royal_minting_programme	According to some ancient commentators, the origin of the coin is the eastern kingdom of Lydia. As controlling the source of coinage bestowed economic benefits, the crude electrum coins were rapidly adopted and developed by the Greek cities and Persians alike. The ‘Darik’, struck by King Darius, showed the king running with a weapon and became the standard across the east until the Alexander’s Macedonian invasion, following which more ornate Greek designs featuring portraits and deities appeared. This new coinage was seen as a potent symbol of power by eastern kings who quickly minted their own versions.	true
technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_reformed_capitation_tax	Although the Sassanids had coins minted, they appear to have been used for much more ceremonial purposes, and when used as economic tools they fast became devalued and mixed with older Arsacid coins. The chief means of economic mobility was therefore primarily barter. In lieu of a strong fiscal motivation, taxation was based on crop-sharing and valuation of crop yields per annum. In addition to a tax on the land, a poll tax was brought against the people themselves, who although offered the option of paying in coin, would more than likely pay instead with goods and crops. Although the taxation system brought coin to the royal coffers, it was seen as inefficient and wasteful; it couldn't take into account fluctuations in land and agricultural yield, and therefore couldn't be planned in advance. It also put a very heavy burden on the common Sassanid peasant, yet all this was initially insignificant to the Shahanshah, who saw his coffers filled with taxed gold.	true

Within the late period Roman army, and in the forces of the barbarian kingdoms that followed the Western Empire’s collapse, soldiers received a stipend from the state. Payment was one of the chief factors in enticing new recruits, even payment in kind through the delivery of food and clothing, which became more commonplace as time wore on. Goods, rather than money, were accepted as payment instead of coin, collected from taxpayers on a regional basis by local government administrators.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_frank_military_improved_siege_engines	The established norms of siege warfare changed during the Middle Ages. The same general principles of starvation and destruction applied, but as cities became larger and more fortified, the method of cracking these increasingly daunting defences also had to adapt. The onager and ballista were still common sights in a siege engineer's arsenal, but so too were newer, more adventurous weapons like the trebuchet and mangonel. Enormous, beam-sling weapons that hurled rocks (or whatever the general chose - even enemy prisoners!) in gigantic arcs before releasing them, created enormous amounts of force with which the attacker hoped to smash down walls or fire over them to destroy the city beyond. However, not always were these weapons the key to victory - at the Siege of Pavia in AD773-4, Charlemagne failed to bring siege equipment to his assault on the Lombard capital, and so the Frankish king was forced to starve the city out. This, combined with a Lombard failure to adequately prepare for the siege, resulted in their capitulation in June of AD774 - such tried and tested methods of old rarely fail, it seems.	true

Bringing everyone in a group together around a large fire kept them warm and allowed hot meals to be shared, ensuring everyone got their fair share. This in turn engendered a sense of community, kept most predators at bay, and instilled a feeling of safety amongst the tribe members. In practice, a large fire was constructed in a circle, and everyone sat around it, talking, eating, drinking, and huddling together for warmth and companionship. Of course, communal spaces also served other important purposes. Stories were passed down from generation to generation this way; tribal histories and legends gradually melded together until they became one and the same.

technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_military_militia	In their original form, militias were simply warriors who adhered to the principles of combat. However, over time they evolved from their Roman roots to mean part-time military forces used for the defence of cities or towns. Before the centralisation of government and the military in the later Middle Ages, noblemen from individual provinces were responsible for fielding troops during wartime, and also the militias that remained behind. The Emirate armies of Cordoba relied on Berber and Andalusian natives for their militias - the veterans of the Syrian garrisons were better suited to forming the core of the emir's standing armies. The Anglo-Saxon system of 'fyrd' and 'select' recruitment perfectly encapsulates the notion of armies and militias during this period - those who did not get drafted into the army to fight their king's wars stayed behind to make their villages safe. Redoubts were strengthened, militias formed, and barricades erected so settlements were fully prepared should the war come to them.	true

For example, Charlemagne was determined to reform the Frankish Kingdom's educational system in favour of broader educational institutions, so that a greater proportion of his subjects could be educated. He did this by inviting Alcuin, a scholar from York, to his court at Aachen, along with Peter of Pisa and others. Alcuin became Charlemagne's 'prime minister of education' and held sway in all scholastic matters for the entire realm, as well as personally tutoring the king.

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_water_power	Before the advent of industrial mechanisation and electric power, harnessing the power of flowing water was the most effective method of generating energy for industry and agriculture. Water wheels and mills were known to have been used throughout ancient Rome and India, whereby the flow of a river (or, in Medieval times, the tide) turns gears and belts to generate power for irrigation. A process known as 'hushing' was developed during the 1st century AD and had been widely adopted by the dawn of the Middle Ages. Hushing is the deliberate and targeted use of torrents of water to wash away layers of soil and debris around seams so that they could be mined, with a sluice gate opened to control the strength of the water flow. In an era before explosives, hushing was an excellent method of revealing the minerals and wealth of the earth - and is still used to some extent in cases where explosives are deemed too destructive to the area being mined.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_payment_in_kind	The soldiers in the Roman army reliably received a stipend of currency from the state well into the 4th century AD; payment was one of the chief factors in enticing new recruits. However, the financial inflation during the Imperial Crisis of the 3rd century AD made joining the army a much less attractive proposal than it used to be. To combat this, the Empire resorted to paying soldiers in kind, through delivery of food and clothing. These were sourced from Roman taxpayers themselves on a regional basis and supervised by the local government administrators. However, no one likes paying taxes, and this may have gone some way, ironically, to explaining the growing animosity towards the military from among the civilian population.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_trade_hubs	Whilst those parts of Europe inside the boundaries of the Roman Empire prospered during antiquity, due to the great roads and merchant fleets built to facilitate commerce, northern, Germanic Europe generally languished in relative isolation. This was only made worse by the movement of the Roman capital further east to Constantinople in the 4th century AD, and the great climate change that ravaged the crops and natural wealth of much of northern and eastern Europe during the Migration Period. By the 7th century AD, however, the Merovingian Frankish kings began revitalising trade in northern Europe with a fair at St. Denis, which connected cities across the northern continent, mainly via old Roman roads and the network of rivers that lattice Europe. As the climate change abated, ports and river villages began to become important trade hubs once again, and none more so than the city of Dorestad. Ideally positioned between the Franks and the Frisians, it allowed merchants a convenient half-way point to meet and do business. Its value, however, dragged it into a battle for power between the two, a conflict that widened as the Middle Ages progressed, ultimately leading to the downfall of Dorestad as a major trading city.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_land_ownership_rights	In order to cement and legitimise their rule, the western barbarians sought to go further than merely adding a layer of their most prestigious people on top of existing Roman society. The Ostrogothic king, Theoderic the Great, for instance, immediately forged alliances through the marriage of his most loyal free men to the daughters of Roman nobles and those of his barbarian rivals amongst the Vandals, etc. in order that society might quickly return to a sense of normality and community, and life might go on relatively unhindered. There was an ulterior motive, however, in that Theoderic wished barbarian Europe to stand behind him against the Eastern Roman Empire and any attempts they may make to recapture the territory lost following the West's collapse. Unfortunately, his marriage-alliance policy was only partially successful; the Visigoths were soon at war with the Franks and Theoderic's alliance with the Vandals floundered after the death of Thrasamund, a fellow Arian Christian and enemy of Constantinople.	true

Although surgery did not take hold for many  centuries to come, the techniques discussed and pioneered during the early Middle Ages were used to help bandage up soldiers so they could continue fighting. Rudimentary approaches to amputation, also, were used to remove mangled or infected limbs, although the victim's chances of survival were extremely slim.

technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_language_of_comradeship	In the militarised societies that dominated antiquity, the ability to keep the army placated and on your side was invaluable – if kings fell from favour they could easily be toppled. A good relationship with the army, therefore, was crucial. It became a political priority, perhaps most famously exemplified by Caesar, who created a cult of personality through the relationship he fostered with his troops - one of mutual deference and respect. His ability to appeal to common soldiers through familiar language broke down the boundaries of status and class between them, resulting in a feeling of identification and comradeship, and their absolute, unflinching loyalty. Over the centuries that followed, many influential generals were proclaimed Emperor by their armies, highlighting the importance of this rapport and the power of the army in the Roman state. In AD476, a Germanic general of foederati, Flavius Odoacer, became King of Italy. The remnants of the Western Roman army revolted and pledged allegiance to him, allowing Odoacer to force the abdication of Romulus Augustulus – effectively the last Emperor in the West – and seize power for himself.	true

In the Ostrogothic kingdom, a disparity occurred between the cultures of the rulers and those they ruled. Theoderic worked hard to keep relations between the Arian Ostrogoths and the Roman Catholics, although they each saw one another as heretics. He created a power-sharing administration between the two sects and was also tolerant of the Jewish population, ruling fairly over matters concerning them. In the Vandal kingdom the path to progress was not so smooth; Trinitarian subjects were persecuted, and bishops were exiled or even killed. This continued for 100 years, until the rule of Hilderic, whose religious tolerance caused the internal friction which was Justinian's justification for the eventual Roman invasion.	true

As time passed, however, the army became more adept as they attempted to simulate Roman military ideals they faced. Also inspired by their own Persian ancestry, the horde mentality of Parthian steppe militarism evolved into a style of more adept, professional horsemen, informed by gradual socio-economic change across the empire.	true

Of course, this also gave them a means of controlling the young, educated Roman class who might otherwise fight against the new regime; by offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, their loyalty could be secured. The barbarian kingdoms were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to be aspired to. Members were obligated to fight for the king, and provide troops from their own retinues, whenever he called them to do so.	true

Monuments and reliefs, however, clearly depict the Shahanshah as a warrior, with no misgivings as to his aggressiveness.

The trumpet was used to rally allies and intimidate enemies in equal measure. There were many variations of this instrument used across the ancient world: the Ebdanians of Hibernia used hollowed-out bull horns, and the Picts and Caledonians used early versions of what would later be called bagpipes.

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_improved_processing_techniques	The Sassanid economy was heavily dependent on agriculture; it was the primary means of earning for the common Persian and the chief means of taxation for the government. The farmers tended to livestock, as well as producing crops of wheat, barley, fruits and vegetables and, although less profitable, rice. Although mainly private sectors, the maintenance of Sassanid agriculture required vast state-led infrastructure, from training to irrigation, and the construction of huge dams and vast qanat networks. This sprawling system of hydraulics was crucial not only for crop cycles, but also for the supply of water to cities where, as well as being reliant on water for basic survival, population growth relied heavily on agricultural output. On a processing level, the transformation of products for sale became more efficient and, in many places, was aided by the state, allowing the Shahanshah to take tighter grip of the Sassanid economy.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_new_city_administration	The Parthian model of governance was very laissez-faire, with numerous satrapies swearing loyalty to the Parthian monarch but acting almost entirely independently, only feeding back support and wealth to the Arsacid rulers. Whilst the satraps invariably rose as one to fight when called upon, the Parthian system allowed the high noble families to exercise vast control over the empire and the Arsacid kings. Ardashir I, the first Sassanid king, placed greater emphasis on the role of the state across the empire. He settled new cities in his name, and renamed old provinces, populating them with his own people. In this way, he created regional headquarters for central administration, pushing his ideology and doctrines across the empire in a more stratified manner.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_improved_siege_engines	The established norms of siege warfare changed during the Middle Ages. The same general principles of starvation and destruction applied, but as cities became larger and more fortified, the method of cracking these increasingly daunting defences also had to adapt. The onager and ballista were still common sights in a siege engineer's arsenal, but so too were newer, more adventurous weapons like the trebuchet and mangonel. Enormous, beam-sling weapons that hurled rocks (or whatever the general chose - even enemy prisoners!) in gigantic arcs before releasing them, created enormous amounts of force with which the attacker hoped to smash down walls or fire over them to destroy the city beyond. However, not always were these weapons the key to victory - at the Siege of Pavia in AD773-4, Charlemagne failed to bring siege equipment to his assault on the Lombard capital, and so the Frankish king was forced to starve the city out. This, combined with a Lombard failure to adequately prepare for the siege, resulted in their capitulation in June of AD774 - such tried and tested methods of old rarely fail, it seems.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_christ_civil_illuminated_manuscripts	As the most studied and referenced book in the age, the Bible was dutifully and exquisitely transcribed in Latin by the monastic orders, in a manner befitting the word of God. One of the most famous manuscripts of the era is the Utrecht Psalter, an exquisite and vibrant collection of ink illustrations accompanying each of the Psalms and one of the most well-known and well-preserved examples of illumination. Also known as 'miniature', from the Latin 'minium' (red lead), used for colouring along with other pigments like vermillion. By the time of late antiquity, papyrus had fallen out of use as a writing surface in favour of the more durable and lasting parchment or vellum, which were carefully prepared before being written upon. Vellum, made from calfskin and usually used for higher-quality texts, was soaked in water and lime and left to dry for several days. Afterwards, excess hair was removed and the skin framed and pressed. Finally, the sheet of vellum was rubbed with a flat object to allow ease of writing; the vellum was then fit for purpose.	true

By the time of Justinian, however, Imperial bureaucrats were much more powerful, holding jurisdiction over revenue-gathering and even dispatched to oversee that military expeditions remained on or close to their agreed budget. Logothetes were paid an allowance of twelve percent of each piece of revenue they gathered in the Empire's name - something that ensured many of them became extremely wealthy.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_civil_coinage	Charlemagne made his mark on Europe in almost every way. Shortly after assuming power, he struck his kingdom's currency, the 'livre', for the first time. A livre could be broken down into twenty 'sous' (known in the old Roman Empire as 'solidus'), which in turn consisted of twelve 'deniers' or silver pennies. The gold solidus, however, was a paper accounting unit only (that is, not physically minted, simply used for division), as the Franks adopted the silver standard and the livre itself was equal in weight to a pound of silver. The system was supposed to be standardised throughout the kingdom but a coin's value frequently differed depending on where it was minted. Despite this, the 'Livre Carolingienne', as it was known, and in particular the denier, became the basis of European currency for year to come, up to the modern age in fact, including influencing the development of the English pound and penny.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_kings_court	Power always was a fickle partner, and no less so in antiquity. The warrior-led societies of ancient Europe were based primarily on the strength of the individual. Much like Attila's empire in the east, western barbarian kingdoms were held together by the passion and power of their leader. A weak man could be toppled by stronger claimants to his throne. However, there were several ways a leader could maintain power. Victory in battle could help ensure he was feared and respected in equal measure; a man who gained glory on the battlefield was more likely to keep the support of his people. A ruler battered by military defeats would be seen as weak and, more importantly, vulnerable to usurpation by a stronger claimant. Power through law and religion was another way to gain and maintain strength. If the king was also the arbiter in all matters - even meting out 'divine justice' then his power extended to the lowest man, helping to reinforce his position further. Of course, loyalty could also be bought with cold, hard bribery; the distribution of prestigious gifts guaranteed the dedication of subordinate chiefs, at least temporarily. There is even evidence of industries dedicated to the production of prestige items, primarily for barbarian kings to purchase loyalty. Of particular value were those items of Roman design, which linked their owners to the resplendence of Imperial Rome.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_arable_land_usage	Throughout the ancient period there was a drive to find new exploitable land, either by clearing forests or, more frequently, draining lakes, marshes and flooded plains. As was often the case in other developmental areas, the Greeks were the first to solve many ancient agricultural problems. Their simple solutions to the problems of drainage and land reclamation worked by positioning long tunnels at the lowest edge of an area of land intended for arable farming the effects of natural drainage were drastically improved. They also raised sloping ground by 'infilling' uneven ground with rocks, then adding clay and top soil to the desired level. As you might expect, before long the techniques they pioneered spread throughout the known world - 'by osmosis' as you might say! - and especially following the Roman expansion following their defeat of Hannibal.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_feudalism	With the collapse of the Roman Empire, the Europe of the Middle Ages evolved the Roman villa system into three elements; the feudal system, manorialism and serfdom. Feudalism divided the king's land into territories (or 'fiefs'), which were ruled by vassals in his name. Most of the land in Carolingian Europe was held 'allodially', meaning the  vassal was vested with total control and (importantly) defence of the land in the name of the king. Manorialism legitimised the power they had, as the manor became the centre of local legal and economic authority. The lord of the manor became the most important local figure, his subjects tasked with working the land surrounding his castle. At the bottom of this system (often represented by a triangle with the king at the apex) were the serfs, who were made to work in a system only slightly removed from slavery. The serfs farmed for their own gain, but owed their masters a share of the produce that was grown. They were totally dependant on the lord's land to work, and were legally bound never to leave his service.	true

Although Rome was no longer the capital it was still the ‘eternal city’ and continued to hold an important position in the imaginations of Romans. During the 5th and 6th centuries AD, three separate tribal confederations attacked Rome; in AD410 the Visigoths sacked the city, followed by the Vandals in AD455, and finally the Ostrogoths in AD546. All of these tribes knew that the key to the city's surrender was to cut off its grain supply. When Alaric I, King of the Visigoths, besieged Rome he made sure to destroy the granaries at Portus, the large artificial harbour that served the city, ensuring famine amongst the Romans and therefore a swift, favourable end to the siege. 	true

They were created as a line of defence against enemies in England, specifically the Vikings, as Viking raids became more common during the 8th and 9th centuries AD. Although many burhs were built atop existing settlements (like the Roman settlement at York) and used Roman walls as defences, new fortifications were established at sites of strategic significance - on the coast, on high ground or defending trade routes. When constructed from nothing, the defenders would create a lattice of palisades and banks behind a large ditch to slow invaders down or impale them as they attempted to enter the burh. Although these sites became towns and cities in their own right later on, at this point in time they were often constructed as a line of defence for the more vulnerable lowlands, and the farmers who lived there.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_defence_depth	Decisive, pitched battles are not always the best option, especially if you are the outnumbered defender. As borders expanded faster than armies could grow, the idea of "preclusive defence" (a line of border forts and outposts to intercept incursions) became more difficult to maintain. "Defence in depth" was a new concept which allowed the enemy to conquer some ground, but spread them out thinly so they could be dealt with more easily. The defenders then closed around and harassed the weaker portions of the invading army, pushing them back to beyond the borders if not destroying them outright. This defensive strategy was further developed during the Middle Ages with the construction of hill forts and concentric castles, which drew the enemy invaders into layers of defences. Methods such as these exacted a heavy toll on attacking forces, as they repeatedly had to run a gauntlet of missile fire whilst scaling the walls.	true

Equus ferus’ role was tied to its physical form – the small, early horse could only be used to pull primitive chariots. Larger, faster horses were later bred and used by skirmishers to chase down troops, but it was not until the development of more muscular breeds that shock troops such as the cataphracts came into being. Their long lances and heavy armour made these new-style heavy cavalry units deadly against infantry, fundamentally changing the nature of warfare forever. The racing of horses for sport went hand in hand with their military use, and of course provided useful training for both rider and animal.	true

Never under the direct command of a Roman, but instead commanded by their tribal leader, they were essentially barbarian warbands with access to state salaries. There were many within the Roman administration that viewed this as an unacceptable sullying of the army’s effective strength, yet the foederati served an important purpose by increasing and solidifying the Empire’s military presence across its vast territory. The tribal warriors, however, did gain a noticeable amount of power, which was key to the Western Roman Empire's eventual undoing.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_trade_goods	Whilst those parts of Europe inside the boundaries of the Roman Empire prospered during antiquity, due to the great roads and merchant fleets built to facilitate commerce, northern, Germanic Europe generally languished in relative isolation. This was only made worse by the movement of the Roman capital further east to Constantinople in the 4th century AD, and the great climate change that ravaged the crops and natural wealth of much of northern and eastern Europe during the Migration Period. By the 7th century AD, however, the Merovingian Frankish kings began revitalising trade in northern Europe with a fair at St. Denis, which connected cities across the northern continent, mainly via old Roman roads and the network of rivers that lattice Europe. As the climate change abated, ports and river villages began to become important trade hubs once again, and none more so than the city of Dorestad. Ideally positioned between the Franks and the Frisians, it allowed merchants a convenient half-way point to meet and do business. Its value, however, dragged it into a battle for power between the two, a conflict that widened as the Middle Ages progressed, ultimately leading to the downfall of Dorestad as a major trading city.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_federate_forces	Just as the Romans had used barbarian allies and auxiliary forces to augment and reinforce their armies, the barbarian kingdoms that followed the Western Empire’s collapse continued to use smaller tribes and confederations to bolster their armies. Commanded by their tribal leader, they were essentially used as a buffer against other groups. For instance, by the beginning of the 6th century AD the Franks, under their great king Clovis I, had allied with the neighbouring Burgundians under Gundobad - sealing the deal through marriage with his daughter Clotilda. For some time, the Burgundians provided military support to Frankish forces against the Visigoths in the far south of the kingdom. Eventually, however, following the deaths of Clovis and Gundobad, the alliance was dissolved and the Burgundian Kingdom absorbed into the growing Frankish Empire.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_new_conscription_system	If the Migration Period made one thing clear, it was that life would never – could never – be the same as it had been for centuries prior. The barbarian kingdoms that swept away the remnants of the Western Roman Empire assumed much of its workable infrastructure, particularly that relating to the organisation of the armed forces. Of course, this also gave them a means of controlling the young, educated Roman class who might otherwise fight against the new regime; by offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, their loyalty could be secured. The barbarian kingdoms were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to be aspired to. Members were obligated to fight for the king, and provide troops from their own retinues, whenever he called them to do so. However, especially early in the kingdoms’ tenure, it is possible that young men not already part of the military aristocracy may have volunteered for service directly to their local lords, for no payment other than much-sought after social standing.   	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_military_military_aristocracy	The real strength of the Sassanid army was, primarily, heavy cavalry and seasoned skirmish troops. The Savaran cavalry were led by the 'great' families of noble Persian and Parthian blood. This mounted corps was also often reinforced by mercenaries. Infantry, by contrast, were not usually held in much regard, with some even referring to the levied Paighan – from which the vast majority of Sassanid infantrymen were drawn - as 'a crowd of pitiable peasants'. These poor quality levies were raised by the aristocracy, conscripted from the lands they owned to act, in most cases, as little more than ‘meat shields’ for the Sassanid advance. This social aristocracy bled quite clearly into the military, and remained as the basis for all military recruitment and conscription until the reforms of Khosrow I, who altered the system so that lesser nobility, primarily farmers and land-owners, could be drawn into the army. This dramatically reduced the aristocracy's power, as the armour and weaponry was provided by the state, meaning the newer forces swore loyalty to the Shahanshah himself, and not his local feudal lords.	true
technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_martial_culture	Battle was an integral part of the various barbarian cultures of antiquity. Tribes of all ethnicities fought the neighbouring Celts, Germans, Slavs, Norsemen, Greeks, nomads and, above all others, the expansionist, imperialist Romans. Amongst themselves, tribes fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class or two nominated champions facing off in single combat. For the would-be warrior, displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids once they had reached manhood. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true
technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_political_subordination	When the Germanic peoples, chiefly the Vandals and various shades of Goth, settled in Italy and Gaul from the 5th century AD, they gradually began to adopt many of the trappings of 'civilisation'. Nothing if not practical, kings and their freeman warriors took the existing administrative structure and legal framework and adapted it for their own use. Previously, legal precedents were required to be held in advocates' - called 'rachimburgs' by the Franks - memories, leading to wildly inconsistent and subjective judgements. Whereas these tribal traditions of oral advocacy worked for a culture constantly on the move, now they had settled tribal laws were adapted to serve the people as a whole, rather than merely resolving conflicts between individuals. As it happened, the barbarians had inherited an administrative system that had been in place for many years, during which many of its peculiarities had been worked out. This made it simpler to 'Germanise' existing Roman laws and 'Latinise' elements of their own at the same time, in the process codifying everything within a single document. Written in Latin, the 'Codex Euricianus', or 'Code of Euric' was probably the first record of its kind; produced around AD480, it is a set of legal rulings and precedents compiled on the orders of the Visigothic king Euric II, who ruled parts of northern Spain and southern France around Toulouse during the 5th century AD. This legal landmark was swiftly followed by the publication of the Frankish 'Lex Salica', around AD500, and the  'Lex Romana Visigothorum', or 'Breviary of Alaric', in AD506. 	true

technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_2_judaism	Food that is 'kosher' meets the criteria of 'kashrut'; Jewish dietary laws. It comes from the Hebrew 'kashér', meaning 'fit' - so kosher means food that is fit to consume. Kashrut details the types of food that are deemed not kosher in a numerous, expansive list drawn from Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Some of the more obscure laws of kashrut forbid the consumption of fruit from a tree not yet three years old, and every type of invertebrate animal. Most well-known is the pig, who is deemed by kashrut to be unclean for having cloven hooves but not chewing the cud. There is much scholarly debate as to why kosher laws exist, with some suggestions that they are concerned with the hygiene considerations of the time, whilst others say non-kosher and non-kosher foods represent religious virtues and vices. 	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_3_judaism	A common practice in Judaism is that of 'ablution' - or ritual purification. A feature of many ancient religions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Shinto, it was believed important to rid oneself of "ritual impurity" before performing certain acts. The procedures of ritual washing are described in rabbinic literature following the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem, and are less extensive than the rituals of the Temple era. Many acts of purification do not require anything more than a washing of the hands, such as before and after meals, or after touching certain parts of the body. Other acts required full immersion in a mikveh (a bath drawn from a natural source); sex, skin conditions and contact with corpses, for instance, require full immersion as part of the ablutions - surely a hygienic consideration as much as a religious one.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_1_judaism	Jewish law does not stop at the religious ceremony. Judaism prescribes rules and enforceable civil and religious laws, with instructions on how to live every aspect of daily life, from waking up in the morning to sleeping in the evening. These laws were collated into a body known as Halakha. These laws claim to preserve the oral Jewish traditions that originated on Mount Sinai and include the 613 'mitzvot', or commandments, known also as the 'Laws of Moses'. The mitzvot are separated into 248 positive commandments and 365 negative commandments - the positive are activities to be undertaken, the negative abstained from at all times. In modern Judaism, the Halakha is much less relevant - modern Reform Judaism placing less importance on them. Orthodox and Conservative Judaism, however, still see the Halakha as fully binding, divine laws.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_4_judaism	In the absence of a king from David's line, the Sanhedrin - assemblies of elected men from across Israel - ordained sages as 'rabbis' - teachers - to give them judicial power. Rabbis came to prominence during the 2nd century AD, when they codified the beliefs and tenets of the faith due to a fear of losing Jewish oral traditions in the wake of Second Temple's destruction and the dissolution of the Sanhedrin amidst increased Roman persecution. The Sanhedrin were part of the Palestinian Patriarchy, or 'Rabbinic' Patriarchy, scholars from the various Talmudic academies who were considered the authority on religious and legal matters across Judaism, and given far-reaching judicial powers. The Patriarchy's chief achievement was the creation of the Mishnah, the first significant revision to the Oral Torah.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_military_long_marches	During late antiquity, there was little attempt by the European powers to stratify and organise their forces in the same way as the Roman army. In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

Whilst their battle tactics were proven, their longbows, often two metres in length and made of yew, lacked the power and accuracy of composite bows made in the east.

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_influenced_legislation	Power always was a fickle partner, and no less so in antiquity. The warrior-led societies of ancient Europe were based primarily on the strength of the individual. Much like Attila's empire in the east, western barbarian kingdoms were held together by the passion and power of their leader. A weak man could be toppled by stronger claimants to his throne. However, there were several ways a leader could maintain power. Victory in battle could help ensure he was feared and respected in equal measure; a man who gained glory on the battlefield was more likely to keep the support of his people. A ruler battered by military defeats would be seen as weak and, more importantly, vulnerable to usurpation by a stronger claimant. Power through law and religion was another way to gain and maintain strength. If the king was also the arbiter in all matters - even meting out 'divine justice' then his power extended to the lowest man, helping to reinforce his position further. Of course, loyalty could also be bought with cold, hard bribery; the distribution of prestigious gifts guaranteed the dedication of subordinate chiefs, at least temporarily. There is even evidence of industries dedicated to the production of prestige items, primarily for barbarian kings to purchase loyalty. Of particular value were those items of Roman design, which linked their owners to the resplendence of Imperial Rome.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_east_civil_state_construction_programme	Construction programmes of great magnitude marked Roman civilisation as surely as their conquests across Europe did. Patronage from Emperors resulted in buildings being erected for the arts and religion. In late antiquity, they mainly arose from Roman Christianity, and the transformation of Constantinople into an 'invincible' Roman capital. Over the course of many Emperors, the walls of the city were expanded and reinforced until finally consisting of an outer wall, an inner wall and numerous internal fortifications, all bristling with defences. The walls of Constantinople constituted one of the greatest defensive works of the time, and the last great fortification of antiquity. The monuments, defensive fortifications, and other city constructions were financed by a combination of state money and local funds, as administration of each zone was the responsibility of either the provincial governor for public works or of the military officials for fortifications. The advent of Christianity saw the blossoming of state-sponsored churches across the entire Empire, and none more so than in Constantinople, where 33 churches were raised during the reign of Justinian alone, including what would later go on to become the Hagia Sophia. Built upon and expanded over time, it became an illustrious example of late Roman architecture, and one of the most important buildings in the world.	true

The law focused the governing of the church on directing the activity of Catholics and propagating the message of Christianity. It is divided into historiographical eras - the 'jus antiquum' being the earliest, being codified following Emperor Constantine’s Edict of Milan, which accepted Christians as part of the Empire and, moreover, decreed that all wrongs done to them be righted as much as possible. Much later, when Christianity had become the central European religion, canonical law not only dictated the Church’s internal administration, but also ecclesiastical jurisdiction, becoming the basis for much of the region’s secular government.	true

The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_exchange_expertise	There is a general assertion among historians that, by AD400, the barbarians’ pottery industry had died. Yet this is oversimplifying the situation somewhat; whilst it is true that specialised industries declined across the Roman Empire and beyond, there were some places where it endured. In Britannia, for example, the pottery industry all but evaporated as the Western Empire floundered. Places like Egypt, however, continued to produce specialised craftsmanship. In Gaul and the north of the Empire, the craftsmanship of previous centuries faded, however, and a more simplified form emerged; one which produced goods more for the sake of sale than skill. With this came a greater co-operation between individuals as craftsmen worked together, not in competition, but due to the shared (and very real) sense that the world was heading into decline. In doing so, individuals, and their families and communities, were able to survive.	true
technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_military_eastern_mounted_tactics	Warfare on the eastern plains and in the deserts, particularly the terrain itself, necessitated the development of specialised tactics, and therefore soldiers trained in the skills needed to use them. The infamous, deadly Parthian Shot – which confounded opponents by appearing to be a retreat until the very final moment, the widespread use of arrows and javelins to skirmish and harass, and the terrifying armoured charge of the mounted cataphracts were all born from the unique topography and arid weather conditions found in the east. Furthermore, by the time of Sassanid Persia and Arab kingdoms such as the Lakhmids, all of these techniques had been in use for several centuries and had won many a battle – even against the well-drilled Roman Legions, who were defeated in detail and annihilated on several occasions as a result. 	true
technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_military_fyrd_training	When the Anglo-Saxon Mercian kings went to war, they called their bannermen to fight with them. Whilst there would be a retinue of thegns to form an elite guard, the bulk of their armies had to come from elsewhere. The common folk of the country, known as the 'fyrd', were the answer. Levying freemen was a tradition from the Mercian's Germanic roots that had endured, and the fyrd fought if not for their king then for their home. Originally, all able-bodied freemen were expected to fight but it quickly became evident that whilst away from their homes, nobody could tend to crops or push the economy along, especially if a war became protracted. Likewise, if too many men died, there would be nobody to work the land when the war was over. From this, the Anglo-Saxons developed the 'select' system, where only certain men - those considered most able for the purpose - would be drafted into the army, whilst the rest would remain and see to the business of keeping the country, not just the army, going for the duration of hostilities.	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_federate_forces	The Roman state had always used barbarian allies and auxiliary forces to augment and reinforce the backbone of its standing armies, but as late antiquity bloomed, the 'foederati' of the Roman state shifted in parameter. Never under the direct command of a Roman, but instead commanded by their tribal leader, they were essentially barbarian warbands with access to state salaries. There were many within the Roman administration that viewed this as an unacceptable sullying of the army’s effective strength, yet the foederati served an important purpose by increasing and solidifying the Empire’s military presence across its vast territory. The tribal warriors, however, did gain a noticeable amount of power, which was key to the Western Roman Empire's eventual undoing.	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_west_civil_tax_farming	The soldiers in the Roman army reliably received a stipend of currency from the state well into the 4th century AD; payment was one of the chief factors in enticing new recruits. However, the financial inflation during the Imperial Crisis of the 3rd century made joining the army a much less attractive proposal than it used to be. To combat this, the Empire resorted to paying soldiers in kind, through delivery of food and clothing. These were sourced from Roman taxpayers themselves on a regional basis and supervised by the praetorian prefects. This may have gone some way, ironically, to explaining the growing animosity towards the military from among the civilian population.	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_new_conscription_system	As the Roman Republic bloomed, and then transformed into Empire, the state was very much a militarised society, with every aspect of Roman life facilitating the army. As the Empire staggered through the 3rd century crisis, nearly imploding under the weight of war and corruption, a gulf emerged between the civilian and military populace. This was exacerbated when Emperor Diocletian divided military and civilian governance into separate bodies, creating numerous stand-off situations between administrators, generals and even the Emperor himself. The changing nature of the armed forces, particularly in the eyes of the common Roman, was such that military service was seen as an unattractive occupation, despite the good wage. This problem was acutely worsened by Diocletian's decision to double the number of Legions. Hereditary service, as well as conscription, became vital to sufficiently man the armed forces. Landowners were also charged with providing quotas of men to maintain Diocletian's swelling ranks.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_trade_goods	Whilst those parts of Europe inside the boundaries of the Roman Empire prospered during antiquity, due to the great roads and merchant fleets built to facilitate commerce, northern, Germanic Europe generally languished in relative isolation. This was only made worse by the movement of the Roman capital further east to Constantinople in the 4th century AD, and the great climate change that ravaged the crops and natural wealth of much of northern and eastern Europe during the Migration Period. By the 7th century AD, however, the Merovingian Frankish kings began revitalising trade in northern Europe with a fair at St. Denis, which connected cities across the northern continent, mainly via old Roman roads and the network of rivers that lattice Europe. As the climate change abated, ports and river villages began to become important trade hubs once again, and none more so than the city of Dorestad. Ideally positioned between the Franks and the Frisians, it allowed merchants a convenient half-way point to meet and do business. Its value, however, dragged it into a battle for power between the two, a conflict that widened as the Middle Ages progressed, ultimately leading to the downfall of Dorestad as a major trading city.	true

The early reforms began to shape the army into a more organised, structured fighting force, and specifically Khosrow's helped to turn it into a well-equipped group, but it was only after increased contact with the enemy that they truly learned. Roman technologies bled across to the Sassanids, and vice versa, as is demonstrated through the Roman use of the 'Clibinarii' - a developed form of cataphract, which in turn became the standard across the ancient world.

On the other hand, attackers knew that starving out the defenders may take time but would likely result in ultimate victory. However, it was only after increased contact with the enemy that they truly learned. Roman siege techniques, and the technology that went with them, took hold elsewhere as the art of urban warfare developed.

Tools of bronze (then iron) enabled the land to be cultivated, ships to be built, stone to be quarried, and wars to be fought with increasing brutality and a terrible savagery. As antiquity subsided into the Middle Ages, blacksmiths remained ubiquitous: every village and town of note had a smithy turning out anything the community needed. Smithing also encouraged trade, as the iron needed to create steel was not always a local resource. Iron gave warriors an edge in combat, often quite literally; it allowed weapons and armour of greater strength to be forged.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_ranged_warfare	The Celtic or Anglo-Saxon warrior was exposed on an open, flat battlefield but, when fighting in hills and woodland, he had the advantage. Most were raised as hunters in dense forests, so became expert at stealthy manoeuvres and laying ambush. Whilst their battle tactics were proven, their longbows, often two metres in length and made of yew, lacked the power and accuracy of composite bows made in the east. Their ammunition was also somewhat lacking: limited iron supplies meant these men often fired bone-tipped arrows that struggled to pierce enemy armour. On the battlefield, archers lined up behind slingers - afforded some protection by the shields of the warriors in front of them.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_roman_civil_price_of_neutrality	The success of Justinian's expedition to reclaim Imperial lands was reliant on several key factors. Firstly, his 'casus belli' - cause for war - had to be just. To overcome this problem the Emperor used dynastic disputes to justify his wars against the Vandals and Ostrogoths. However, he also had to minimise the chances of outside interference. Therefore, whilst Belisarius was preparing his forces, the Emperor himself opened communication with the Franks, whose neutrality in the coming conflict he attempted to secure through a payment of gold. Ultimately, this didn't stop the Franks from capitalising on the situation; having watched events closely from across the Alps, their army invaded Italy in AD539 and defeated both Roman and Ostrogothic forces before falling to dysentery.	true

Visigothic rule was mostly focused on military and agricultural development to sustain the economy, but the caliphates were much more interested in revitalising the country's potential. As well as being a major production centre for silver, the Muslims developed Spain's silk industry by bringing the cotton plant to the region and turning Al-Andalus into a powerhouse of silk manufacture. They also enhanced the basic Roman irrigation systems with a canal system (based on the eastern 'qanats') that helped agriculture to thrive in the largely-arid climate.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_military_warrior_culture	Battle was an integral part of Dark Age 'barbarian' culture. Tribes frequently fought the neighbouring Germanic, Nordic, Celtic, and nomadic peoples, and even amongst themselves. Inter-tribal battles were generally fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class. Neighbouring rivals raided each other’s territory almost as sport, rather than as a serious, organised attempt to expand their boundaries. On the other hand, the wild Norsemen did so because their land couldn't produce the agricultural yields needed to feed their growing population, eventually settling in places such as England and France, where the conditions were more favourable. For the would-be warrior displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids from the age of fourteen upward. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true

These men were held in particularly high esteem and reported directly to the judge or, in many cases, passed judgement themselves based on their understanding of legal precedents. Carolingian law also forbade judges, in a bizarrely obvious move, from accepting bribes and told them to make decisions based solely on evidence and inquest.

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_gatherings	Nights were long, cold, and dark on the steppes and in the forests of Europe. Bringing everyone in a group together around a large fire, sometimes in a large, communal hall, kept them warm and allowed hot meals to be shared, ensuring everyone got their fair share. This in turn engendered a sense of community, kept most predators at bay, and instilled a feeling of safety amongst the tribe members. In practice, a large fire was constructed in a circle, and everyone sat around it, talking, eating, drinking, and huddling together for warmth and companionship. Of course, communal spaces also served other important purposes. Stories were passed down from generation to generation this way; tribal histories and legends gradually melded together until they became one and the same. A gathering of the entire group also gave its leaders the opportunity to reveal their plans to everyone at once, and deal with any questions or concerns they may have.	true

Gondishapur became such a centre of medical learning that many scholars credit it as the birthplace of the modern hospital system. The 'House of Wisdom', also, established in the late 8th century AD in Baghdad, became a repository of knowledge and progressive thinking, and as such attracted many scholars and intellectuals to creating a melting pot of ideologies.

technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_state_maintenance	Construction programmes of great magnitude marked Roman civilisation as surely as their conquests across Europe did. Patronage from Emperors resulted in buildings being erected for the arts and religion. In late antiquity, construction programmes mainly arose out of the advent of Roman Christianity, and from the transformation of Constantinople into an 'invincible' Roman capital. Over the course of many Emperors the walls of the city were expanded and reinforced until finally consisting of an outer wall, an inner wall and numerous internal fortifications, all bristling with defences. The walls of Constantinople constituted one of the greatest defensive works of the time, and the last great fortification of antiquity. The monuments, defensive fortifications, and other city constructions were financed by a combination of state money and local funds, as administration of each zone was the responsibility of either the provincial governor for public works or of the military officials for fortifications. The advent of Christianity saw the blossoming of state-sponsored churches across the entire Empire, none more so than in Constantinople, where 33 churches were raised during the reign of Justinian alone, including the church that would later go on to become the Hagia Sophia. The Hagia Sophia was built on and expanded over time, becoming one of the most illustrious examples of late Roman architecture, and one of the most important architectural creations in the world.	true

This was done originally for agricultural purposes but later also for property development. Although initially a state legislature, the late Empire saw the rights of emphyteusis and superficies, whereby a private landowner could rent out land to others. As the Empire passed into late antiquity, the law of emphyteusis became more and more prevalent, with 'posessio ad  tempus locata' (long-lease contracts) replacing the locatio-conductio (short term) contracts.

The etymology of 'bazaar' is 'baha-char' in Pahlavi, which means 'the place of prices' - a somewhat fitting name for a place where no price was fixed and almost everything was for sale. Although not an uncommon concept throughout the ancient world, bazaars were mostly found along crucial trade routes such as the Silk Road, sometimes becoming so important that new towns and cities sprouted up around them. Bazaars were not only centres of commerce, but also important places for social and religious gatherings; mosques and other places of worship became part of bazaar complexes, as well as areas of rest and entertainment.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_combined_arms	The Carolingians fought their wars in a much more organised way than any of their contemporaries, harking back to the complex, almost industrial-scale military structure of the Roman Empire. Charlemagne's overarching strategy differed from that of his forebears, with heavy-handed, decisive assaults on his enemy's vital regions and heartlands, yet his battlefield tactics remained distinctly similar to those of his ancestors. Cavalry skirmished, threw javelins and generally harassed enemies, whilst infantry followed close behind to join the melee at the heart of any battle. Archery was the job of infantry, with very few mounted archers on the battlefield. The Kingdom of Asturias, fighting against the Muslims over the Spanish border to the south, emulated the Frankish style as much as possible, though tribal elements, drawn from their 'barbarian' Visigothic roots, still featured heavily in their way of war.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_maximisation_of_raiding_profits	'Nomad' peoples followed the seasons with their herds, rather than having a settled agricultural lifestyle. The word itself is a Greek term and, as might be expected of the civilised, settled Greeks, they did not approve of barbarous nomads in the slightest. Nomads, on the other hand, may not have had permanent settlements, but their lives were as full and rich as settled farmer or city dwellers and probably healthier too, as they didn’t live in squalor. Nomadism is an extremely effective way of living off areas with scarce natural resources, such as the steppes. With their herds of domesticated animals nomadic tribesmen travel from camp to camp following the seasons and the grazing they need to maintain. As such, they rely on sheep and goats to provide meat, milk, hides and wool as the basis of their entire way of life. As grazing is exhausted, the herds can be moved on and the land left to recover until the following year. Despite lacking the supposed benefits of a settled community, the ancient nomads could nevertheless prosper. With fearsome warriors among their numbers, they were not above 'foraging' by raiding nearby settlements and farms! This was also an extremely effective and ruthless way of raising troops. The easiest way of harvesting scarce resources is, of course, to take them from someone else. The tribe who could not protect their own livestock, property and kin soon ceased to exist. This also encouraged the worst feature of nomad life for neighbouring, settled peoples: nomads will raid and steal from weak, sedentary folk because they are just another resource to be exploited. 	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_horse_breeding	A source of food, a symbol of wealth, a beast of burden and a tool of war, the horse was one of the most versatile commodities in the ancient world. Equus ferus’ role was tied to its physical form – the small, early horse could only be used to pull primitive chariots. Larger, faster horses were later bred and used by skirmishers to chase down troops, but it was not until the development of more muscular breeds that shock troops such as the cataphracts came into being. Their long lances and heavy armour made these new-style heavy cavalry units deadly against infantry, fundamentally changing the nature of warfare forever. The racing of horses for sport went hand in hand with their military use, and of course provided useful training for both rider and animal.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_simplification_of_production	There is a general assertion among historians that, by AD400, the barbarians’ pottery industry had died. Yet this is oversimplifying the situation somewhat; whilst it is true that specialised industries declined across the Roman Empire and beyond, there were some places where it endured. In Britannia, for example, the pottery industry all but evaporated as the Western Empire floundered. Places like Egypt, however, continued to produce specialised craftsmanship. In Gaul and the north of the Empire, the craftsmanship of previous centuries faded, however, and a more simplified form emerged; one which produced goods more for the sake of sale than skill. With this came a greater co-operation between individuals as craftsmen worked together, not in competition, but due to the shared (and very real) sense that the world was heading into decline. In doing so, individuals, and their families and communities, were able to survive.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_division_of_lands	The awarding of land to guarantee loyalty became more and more common during late antiquity. This wasn’t done to reduce the chances of rebellion amongst the noble classes, but to bypass them altogether – whole populations were moved to richer, more fertile lands, which meant all sections of the population felt a bond of gratitude to their king and therefore were more likely to support him during difficult times. Each person was allotted a plot of land upon which they could grow crops and raise livestock for food and, if they were lucky, the ever-more-lucrative trade markets that were opening up due to the Silk Road and religious links between such kingdoms as Aksum, in the Horn of Africa, and the Roman Empire. As this inevitably led to an increase in the quality of individual citizens’ lives, it also led to increased loyalty and reduced influence for local nobles, whose whims and fancies had previously affected the fates of many and caused many a promising society to collapse altogether.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_defence_in_depth	'Defence in Depth' is a theory held amongst some historians that Roman defensive military strategy evolved in the 4th century AD from the previous ideology of 'preclusive defence'. Preclusive defence was Rome's method of neutralising incursions by stationing units along its border, as well as in forward outposts, to trap enemy forces that came between them in a pincer movement. However, Roman borders became too vast to defend properly in this manner; limitanei couldn't hope to successfully defend fortifications until comitatenses swept in from outlying regions to neutralise the threat. This led to the development of defence in depth, a technique whereby the enemy army is given some ground over a large area, weakening its supply logistics as it spreads itself too thinly. Then, its weaker positions are attacked by the defending army, with the intention of repelling the enemy back to its original position - outside the boundaries the strategy was intended to defend. Defence in depth was common in late antiquity, when Rome's Western Empire became too ungainly, and among the barbarian kingdoms that succeeded it, in order to maintain their new-found and hard-won frontiers.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_call_vassals	If the collapse of the Roman Empire made one thing clear, it was that life would never – could never – be the same as it had been for centuries prior. The barbarian kingdoms that swept away Rome's remnants assumed much of its workable infrastructure, particularly that relating to the organisation of the armed forces. By offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, loyalty could be secured. The kingdoms of the late Dark and early Middle Ages were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to aspire to. Members were obligated to fight for the king and provide troops from their own retinues whenever he called them to do so. In return, they were given lands and titles under the proviso that they enforced the king's laws and offered protection to the peasants who worked their lands. In real terms, this was a license to behave in almost any way the vassals liked - they had the weapons and the training to make any point they so chose; the serfs, on the other hand, had none of those things, and therefore no chance to rise up and change their situation.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_civil_illuminated_manuscripts	As the most studied and referenced book in the age, the Bible was dutifully and exquisitely transcribed in Latin by the monastic orders, in a manner befitting the word of God. One of the most famous manuscripts of the era is the Utrecht Psalter, an exquisite and vibrant collection of ink illustrations accompanying each of the Psalms and one of the most well-known and well-preserved examples of illumination. Also known as 'miniature', from the Latin 'minium' (red lead), used for colouring along with other pigments like vermillion. By the time of late antiquity, papyrus had fallen out of use as a writing surface in favour of the more durable and lasting parchment or vellum, which were carefully prepared before being written upon. Vellum, made from calfskin and usually used for higher-quality texts, was soaked in water and lime and left to dry for several days. Afterwards, excess hair was removed and the skin framed and pressed. Finally, the sheet of vellum was rubbed with a flat object to allow ease of writing; the vellum was then fit for purpose.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_roman_civil_pragmatic_sanctions	Emperor Justinian's legacy lasted long after his death. One of his greatest achievements was the creation of the 'Corpus Juris Civilis', a complete revision of Roman legal law. A sweepingly comprehensive account of both old and current legal statutes, it became the basis of all Latinate legal theory. Justinian exercised this legal power in his Pragmatic Sanction of AD554, where he reorganised the government of Italy following Belisarius' successful conquest – the sanction empowered the Italian Church and returned lands and slaves that had been confiscated by the Ostrogoths to the Roman aristocracy, as well as implementing the administrative and tax systems of Constantinople. In addition, all Roman Senators were restored to power. The installation of these statutes in Italy helped them disseminate across the rest of the former Western Empire, eventually forming the groundwork for much modern European law still in effect today.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_military_levied_troops	In the ancient world, it was sometimes deemed necessary to supplement trained forces with a levy of largely untrained men, usually to pin down or distract the enemy sufficiently for the professional troops to outflank them. In times of need, levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army - whether citizens or subjects. Eastern armies, for example, were created by command of the king, who ordered his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. The nobles or local dignitaries brought their households, attendant warriors, and levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_trade_goods	Whilst those parts of Europe inside the boundaries of the Roman Empire prospered during antiquity, due to the great roads and merchant fleets built to facilitate commerce, northern, Germanic Europe generally languished in relative isolation. This was only made worse by the movement of the Roman capital further east to Constantinople in the 4th century AD, and the great climate change that ravaged the crops and natural wealth of much of northern and eastern Europe during the Migration Period. By the 7th century AD, however, the Merovingian Frankish kings began revitalising trade in northern Europe with a fair at St. Denis, which connected cities across the northern continent, mainly via old Roman roads and the network of rivers that lattice Europe. As the climate change abated, ports and river villages began to become important trade hubs once again, and none more so than the city of Dorestad. Ideally positioned between the Franks and the Frisians, it allowed merchants a convenient half-way point to meet and do business. Its value, however, dragged it into a battle for power between the two, a conflict that widened as the Middle Ages progressed, ultimately leading to the downfall of Dorestad as a major trading city.	true

In recent years, many complex, beautiful artefacts that attest to this have been discovered during archaeological excavations. Through the study of their distinctive patterns it has been possible to piece together a timeline of the emergence and expansion of the production methods and technology used. By specialising in a particular skill or craft, a man's worth increased exponentially, and the items he produced became far more valuable than the cost of the materials used. This, in turn, guaranteed a livelihood for many.	true

technologies_long_description_att_celtic_furor_celtica_state_caledonians	The Celts were a true warrior society and, although they lacked the elegance, sophistication and order of a Roman, Greek or Persian battle formation, they were nevertheless a ferocious fighting force. The Celts' fighting style was wild and chaotic, their central tactic a massive charge to the enemy's frontline. The Romans came to know and fear this manoeuvre, referring to it as 'Furor Celtica' - literally 'Fury of the Celts'. The Romans, clad in armour, could secure victory if they survived the initial charge, but therein lay the challenge - the Celts' frenzied and barbaric attacks often overwhelmed even the most ordered of legionary formations.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_warrior_culture	Battle was an integral part of Dark Age 'barbarian' culture. Tribes frequently fought the neighbouring Germanic, Nordic, Celtic, and nomadic peoples, and even amongst themselves. Inter-tribal battles were generally fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class. Neighbouring rivals raided each other’s territory almost as sport, rather than as a serious, organised attempt to expand their boundaries. On the other hand, the wild Norsemen did so because their land couldn't produce the agricultural yields needed to feed their growing population, eventually settling in places such as England and France, where the conditions were more favourable. For the would-be warrior displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids from the age of fourteen upward. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_siege_stores	Sieges in the Dark and early Middle Ages were varied affairs - they either ended in a short, bloody battle, or settled into protracted situations of more devious strategies and classic blockade warfare. For the defenders, they were often secure in the knowledge that an enemy assault on the walls would be easy for them to repel. On the other hand, attackers knew that starving out the defenders may take time but would likely result in ultimate victory. However, it was only after increased contact with the enemy that they truly learned. Roman siege techniques, and the technology that went with them, took hold elsewhere as the art of urban warfare developed. Many powers kept secret supply networks and vast stores of food in preparation for drawn-out assaults. Much of this went unnoticed, allowing their armies to outlast the enemy on each occasion. 	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_feudalism	With the collapse of the Roman Empire, the Europe of the Middle Ages evolved the Roman villa system into three elements; the feudal system, manorialism and serfdom. Feudalism divided the king's land into territories (or 'fiefs'), which were ruled by vassals in his name. Most of the land in Carolingian Europe was held 'allodially', meaning the  vassal was vested with total control and (importantly) defence of the land in the name of the king. Manorialism legitimised the power they had, as the manor became the centre of local legal and economic authority. The lord of the manor became the most important local figure, his subjects tasked with working the land surrounding his castle. At the bottom of this system (often represented by a triangle with the king at the apex) were the serfs, who were made to work in a system only slightly removed from slavery. The serfs farmed for their own gain, but owed their masters a share of the produce that was grown. They were totally dependant on the lord's land to work, and were legally bound never to leave his service.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_civil_church_scholars	Following the collapse of the Roman system along with its Western Empire, the Church gradually established cathedral schools. They were intended as centres of literary, religious and civil learning, as opposed to simply teaching nobles the ways of war. For example, Charlemagne was determined to reform the Frankish Kingdom's educational system in favour of broader educational institutions, so that a greater proportion of his subjects could be educated. He did this by inviting Alcuin, a scholar from York, to his court at Aachen, along with Peter of Pisa and others. Alcuin became Charlemagne's 'prime minister of education' and held sway in all scholastic matters for the entire realm, as well as personally tutoring the king. Later, Charlemagne decreed the 'Charter of Modern Thought', with the view that every boy should be given a basic education, not just the sons of the noble elite.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_roman_civil_craft_organisations	The skill of Roman craftsmen is well known due to artefacts that have been discovered during excavations, and through surviving written works of the time. Through careful study, these sources have illuminated the field of Roman craftsmanship in late antiquity, marked by a gradual decline in artisanship and a movement towards very primitive forms of mass production. Although many in the Empire maintained their ancient craft and production methods, the eastern fabricae – the forerunner of the factory, in which a great deal of weapons and armour were made at a quality ostensibly less than that of a premier smith – gradually took over from individuals designing and making unique, bespoke pieces to order. The results speak for themselves.	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_legacy_1	By perfecting concrete, a plentiful and cheap building material, the Romans were able to build structures quickly and without the need for vast teams of skilled craftsmen. Timber frames, or moulds, were used to provide a framework for the concrete walls; constructing them was a task that could be done by a relatively unskilled labourer. The frameworks could also be re-used, making the whole process relatively cheap, quick and efficient. This could prove vital in times of war when defensive structures needed to be built quickly.	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_legacy_2	In the ancient world the gods controlled, and thus were responsible for, everything that happened. This worldview went unquestioned until Thales of Miletus started searching for rational rather than supernatural explanations for the way the world worked. His thinking was followed up by a stream of great thinkers who speculated that the world was governed by a single substance. This school of thought then expanded to suggest that, aside from the known earth, water, wind and fire, there were many elements at play that made up the world and, by the early 5th century BC, the concept of tiny particles called atoms was first presented.	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_legacy_3	Roman philosopher and writer, Pliny the Elder, described Rome’s sewers as an engineering achievement “more stupendous than any”. Rome’s biggest sewer, the Cloaca Maxima, was first dug as a system to carry water from nearby marshland and grew into a complex network of sewers that expanded with the city. The whole system was eventually covered, shutting off the stench and risk of disease, making it Rome’s greatest advancement in sewer construction. The Cloaca Maxima became so vital to Rome’s development it was even granted its own deity: Cloacina, goddess of the sewer.	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_legacy_4	Derived from the Latin term 'concretus', meaning 'grow together', the development of concrete transformed Roman construction methods. The addition of 'pozzolana', a sandy black volcanic ash named after an area around the Bay of Naples, created a stronger paste which allowed for construction underwater, something crucial for bridge building. Concrete also allowed the construction of elaborate architectural features, such as curved columns and arches, the most notable examples of these being in the Pantheon in Rome.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_military_siege_stores	Sieges in the Dark and early Middle Ages were varied affairs - they either ended in a short, bloody battle, or settled into protracted situations of more devious strategies and classic blockade warfare. For the defenders, they were often secure in the knowledge that an enemy assault on the walls would be easy for them to repel. On the other hand, attackers knew that starving out the defenders may take time but would likely result in ultimate victory. However, it was only after increased contact with the enemy that they truly learned. Roman siege techniques, and the technology that went with them, took hold elsewhere as the art of urban warfare developed. Many powers kept secret supply networks and vast stores of food in preparation for drawn-out assaults. Much of this went unnoticed, allowing their armies to outlast the enemy on each occasion. 	true

technologies_long_description_att_celtic_furor_celtica	The Celts were a true warrior society and, although they lacked the elegance, sophistication and order of a Roman, Greek or Persian battle formation, they were nevertheless a ferocious fighting force. The Celts' fighting style was wild and chaotic, their central tactic a massive charge to the enemy's frontline. The Romans came to know and fear this manoeuvre, referring to it as 'Furor Celtica' - literally 'Fury of the Celts'. The Romans, clad in armour, could secure victory if they survived the initial charge, but therein lay the challenge - the Celts' frenzied and barbaric attacks often overwhelmed even the most ordered of legionary formations.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_improved_siege_engines	The established norms of siege warfare changed during the Middle Ages. The same general principles of starvation and destruction applied, but as cities became larger and more fortified, the method of cracking these increasingly daunting defences also had to adapt. The onager and ballista were still common sights in a siege engineer's arsenal, but so too were newer, more adventurous weapons like the trebuchet and mangonel. Enormous, beam-sling weapons that hurled rocks (or whatever the general chose - even enemy prisoners!) in gigantic arcs before releasing them, created enormous amounts of force with which the attacker hoped to smash down walls or fire over them to destroy the city beyond. However, not always were these weapons the key to victory - at the Siege of Pavia in AD773-4, Charlemagne failed to bring siege equipment to his assault on the Lombard capital, and so the Frankish king was forced to starve the city out. This, combined with a Lombard failure to adequately prepare for the siege, resulted in their capitulation in June of AD774 - such tried and tested methods of old rarely fail, it seems.	true

Even outside of the industrial and agricultural systems, armies often used nature, fashioning siege equipment and defences out of trees and the land around them. Every aspect of society felt the strain of waging conquest or defending against invaders. Men from the Sassanid Empire were drafted from the peasantry to fight, and most likely die, for their lord when the king called them to war. Those not called to fight had their work and produce requisitioned, particularly during last-minute preparations, such as the defence of a city. 	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_slavic_assimilation_antes	The Slavic lands, due to their position in eastern Europe, inevitably became a cultural melting pot for the various migrating tribes. Goths, Sarmatians and Greeks all passed through what is now the Ukraine, and mingled with the Slavic culture found there. In many of these circumstances, the indigenous Slavs assimilated the foreign cultures into their own - the Thracians, for instance, vanished as a unique entity and were absorbed wholly into the Slavic collective. However, it was not always the case that the Slavs dominated culturally - when some tribes migrated into densely populated Greek territory, the Slavs found themselves Hellenised instead.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_military_militia	In their original form, militias were simply warriors who adhered to the principles of combat. However, over time they evolved from their Roman roots to mean part-time military forces used for the defence of cities or towns. Before the centralisation of government and the military in the later Middle Ages, noblemen from individual provinces were responsible for fielding troops during wartime, and also the militias that remained behind. The Emirate armies of Cordoba relied on Berber and Andalusian natives for their militias - the veterans of the Syrian garrisons were better suited to forming the core of the emir's standing armies. The Anglo-Saxon system of 'fyrd' and 'select' recruitment perfectly encapsulates the notion of armies and militias during this period - those who did not get drafted into the army to fight their king's wars stayed behind to make their villages safe. Redoubts were strengthened, militias formed, and barricades erected so settlements were fully prepared should the war come to them.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_civil_church_scholars	Following the collapse of the Roman system along with its Western Empire, the Church gradually established cathedral schools. They were intended as centres of literary, religious and civil learning, as opposed to simply teaching nobles the ways of war. For example, Charlemagne was determined to reform the Frankish Kingdom's educational system in favour of broader educational institutions, so that a greater proportion of his subjects could be educated. He did this by inviting Alcuin, a scholar from York, to his court at Aachen, along with Peter of Pisa and others. Alcuin became Charlemagne's 'prime minister of education' and held sway in all scholastic matters for the entire realm, as well as personally tutoring the king. Later, Charlemagne decreed the 'Charter of Modern Thought', with the view that every boy should be given a basic education, not just the sons of the noble elite.	true

However, Anglo-Saxon laws were written in their native tongue as opposed to Latin, and were generally decided by committee, at least at first, rather than being version of Roman law. Anglo-Saxon law was first codified from its oral roots by King Aethelberht of Kent, "according to the examples of the Romans", which most historians take to mean as written down, rather than citing Roman legal precedent. He also decreed that it was to be written in Old English, rather than Latin, which established a tradition which lasted almost five hundred years.	true

The king also called together chieftains to meet in a gathering known as a 'thing' (in the Nordic countries) or a 'folkmoot' (in Anglo-Saxon ones). This was a place where grievances could be aired and issues of general policy and direction could be discussed.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_hard_training	The armies of the early Middle Ages were built upon a strong backbone of elite troops, drawn from the noble and aristocratic classes. These men generally had the best armour, the best weapons and the best horses. They hunted, trained against dummies and each other, and were primed and ready for war whenever it came. However, they alone were too small a force to form a real standing army, and so levies padded out their numbers. Mustered together by regional lords and vassals to the king, levied troops were trained as well as individual lords could afford. This meant that the quality of levies, whilst never exceptional, varied from place to place - some were afforded weapons and armour by their masters, whereas others had to make do with what they could find at home or, worse, on the battlefield. Some lords also relied on mercenaries - often roaming tribes of barbarians who fought for coin - to sharpen their forces with a battle-hardened edge.	true

Although surgery did not take hold for many  centuries to come, the techniques discussed and pioneered during the early Middle Ages were used to help bandage up soldiers so they could continue fighting. Rudimentary approaches to amputation, also, were used to remove mangled or infected limbs, although the victim's chances of survival were extremely slim. The surgeon was in the business of patching up warriors; later, if wounds became infected and resulted in death, that was simply none of his concern.	true

It wasn’t until Euric became king that he was able to defeat many of the powerful chieftains and unite them under one leader. With this new found power, Euric expanded the bounds of his territory into Hispania; by the time of the Western Roman Empire's collapse he had taken control of most of the Iberian Peninsula, all except Galatia. On his death the Visigoths also controlled around a third of Gaul, although they eventually lost all their holdings in the south of the country due to the relentless expansion of the neighbouring Frankish Empire.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_civil_trade_hubs	Whilst those parts of Europe inside the boundaries of the Roman Empire prospered during antiquity, due to the great roads and merchant fleets built to facilitate commerce, northern, Germanic Europe generally languished in relative isolation. This was only made worse by the movement of the Roman capital further east to Constantinople in the 4th century AD, and the great climate change that ravaged the crops and natural wealth of much of northern and eastern Europe during the Migration Period. By the 7th century AD, however, the Merovingian Frankish kings began revitalising trade in northern Europe with a fair at St. Denis, which connected cities across the northern continent, mainly via old Roman roads and the network of rivers that lattice Europe. As the climate change abated, ports and river villages began to become important trade hubs once again, and none more so than the city of Dorestad. Ideally positioned between the Franks and the Frisians, it allowed merchants a convenient half-way point to meet and do business. Its value, however, dragged it into a battle for power between the two, a conflict that widened as the Middle Ages progressed, ultimately leading to the downfall of Dorestad as a major trading city.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_centralised_authoritarian_society	Before the rise of Attila, who eventually became king of all the Huns, the Hunnic nation was run by several leaders, with one chief 'king' of them all. These leaders were all semi-independent yet internally ranked against one another. Over time they vanished and an authoritarian, dictatorial system emerged as Attila, at first co-ruling with his brother, Bleda, forged a Hunnic empire. Attila's rule was based primarily on intimidation of every tribe and people he encountered, maintaining power and control over them through terror. The ceaseless savagery Attila inflicted upon those who opposed him served as a warning to others, even forcing super powers such as the Eastern Romans to acquiesce to his diplomatic demands. In order to facilitate this strategy, Attila surrounded himself with various aides and chiefs from other cultures, using them as spies. He kept control of his empire by knowing his enemy's moves and keeping his subjects in check through fear, power and controlling access to information and knowledge. Attila's dictatorial control was so great that its survival was tied almost entirely to him - when he died, the fractures were almost immediate, as lesser tribes supplanted his leadership with their own local leaders, breaking his Hunnic empire apart.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_military_professional_soldiers	Traditionally, the citizen armies of the Dark Ages were supplied by a combination of levies and volunteer troops.

The professional soldier was a different beast entirely; he gave his life to the army, never thinking too much about what awaited him back home. However, when a state discharged these men without suitable reward, they often turned to their generals for help.

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_divine_sanction	Administrative and economic reform was difficult in the early days of the Sassanid empire, as the powerful noble dynasties, vying for personal power, created too much pressure to allow stable long-term reforms to take place and causing the economy to stagnate. The revolt of Mazdak, however, shattered the socio-economic system and entirely crushed the power of the nobility. Seizing the chance, the Shahanshah immediately put down the rebellion and took control, now free of the nobles’ stranglehold. He implemented sweeping reforms, creating a system of administrative districts and laws, and systemised taxes and imposts in the way the House of Sassan had envisioned. Over time, other eastern kingdoms took their lead from the Persian example, reducing the risk of insurrection by adding checks and balances to their internal systems, chiefly through the appointment of government officials whose job it was to ensure the king’s wishes were carried out to the letter.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_military_call_vassals	If the collapse of the Roman Empire made one thing clear, it was that life would never – could never – be the same as it had been for centuries prior. The barbarian kingdoms that swept away Rome's remnants assumed much of its workable infrastructure, particularly that relating to the organisation of the armed forces. By offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, loyalty could be secured. The kingdoms of the late Dark and early Middle Ages were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to aspire to. Members were obligated to fight for the king and provide troops from their own retinues whenever he called them to do so. In return, they were given lands and titles under the proviso that they enforced the king's laws and offered protection to the peasants who worked their lands. In real terms, this was a license to behave in almost any way the vassals liked - they had the weapons and the training to make any point they so chose; the serfs, on the other hand, had none of those things, and therefore no chance to rise up and change their situation.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_military_new_supply_system_and_armament_stores	Before the reforms of Khosrow I, equipment was generally provided by the soldiers themselves. As the Sassanid standing army was drawn mainly from the upper aristocracy, money was no object and equipping horse and rider was simple. With Khosrow's military shakeup, however, things changed. With the newly emerged lower nobility, the Dekhan, now able to enlist, their equipment and training was provided by the central government. The Shahanshah enforced 'equipment lists' when mustering to ensure all soldiers were correctly geared. Armaments were also made and stored during peacetime in arsenals, ready for immediate distribution when hostilities commenced. In this way, an army was created that was capable of deploying faster and fighting longer on multiple fronts. When the Shahanshah did call his satraps to war, men would rally from all corners of the empire, each bringing their regional individualities. Over time, a level of regimentation emerged, with a standardisation emerging of heavy armour for nobility, but with caveats for archery. The numerous light horse archers, in the Parthian style, became more organised with standardised armour and bows. The individual style of regional forces remained, but the organisation of the Sassanid war machine greatly improved.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_english_civil_illuminated_manuscripts	As the most studied and referenced book in the age, the Bible was dutifully and exquisitely transcribed in Latin by the monastic orders, in a manner befitting the word of God. One of the most famous manuscripts of the era is the Utrecht Psalter, an exquisite and vibrant collection of ink illustrations accompanying each of the Psalms and one of the most well-known and well-preserved examples of illumination. Also known as 'miniature', from the Latin 'minium' (red lead), used for colouring along with other pigments like vermillion. By the time of late antiquity, papyrus had fallen out of use as a writing surface in favour of the more durable and lasting parchment or vellum, which were carefully prepared before being written upon. Vellum, made from calfskin and usually used for higher-quality texts, was soaked in water and lime and left to dry for several days. Afterwards, excess hair was removed and the skin framed and pressed. Finally, the sheet of vellum was rubbed with a flat object to allow ease of writing; the vellum was then fit for purpose.	true

It did not become the official religion of the empire until much later, but the Shahanshahs had an interesting and continued relationship with the faith from the inception of the empire under Ardashir I. The sanction, by the Zoroastrian church, helped to legitimise the administration and empower the new king. A legitimate, religiously-approved king would be better liked by his pious subjects, and allow him to become a patron for the religion, benefiting both institutions. Although Ardashir identified as broadly Zoroastrian, Shapur I was determined to officialise the religion; he founded many fire temples across Persian territory and vested his own man, Kirder, with the power to implement sweeping religious changes. Shapur, in this way, laid the groundwork for later Shahs to take control of, and institutionalise, the Zoroastrian faith - as Yazdegerd II eventually achieved.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_frank_military_stirrup	Although the horse was always a valuable tool in pre-industrialised warfare, it was not until the development of the stirrup that cavalry truly became a properly versatile battlefield force. Although stirrups were first used by the Assyrians in approximately 700BC, they were rudimentary cloth pads that provided no real stability for the rider. It was the Sarmatians that developed the single stirrup, much similar to the device we now know, during the 1st century BC, but it wasn't until the 5th century AD that it began to spread to western Europe. As the Avars migrated across the continent, they brought their impressive nomad cavalry technology with them. Stirrups enabled a rider more stability atop his horse, especially in conjunction with developments in saddle technology; the pommel saddle giving more rigid support and allowing riders to control their horses whilst wielding weapons at the same time. With support beneath from a sturdy saddle and with well-developed stirrups, the horseman was both master of his steed and master of the battlefield.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_professional_soldiery	Traditionally, the citizen armies of the ancient world were supplied by a combination of levies and volunteer troops. Often farmers and landowners, these men ultimately looked to return to their plots and families, comforted by the spoils of war. The professional solider was a different beast entirely. He gave his life to the army, never wavering to think on what awaited him back home. However, when a state discharged these men without suitable reward, they often turned to their generals. If successful in finding the spoils to offer his men, a general could exert huge influence and power. In 88BC Sulla was the first aggrieved general to march his men towards Rome, an act which led to many marches on the city by power hungry generals, followed by strong and powerful armies. 	true
technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_civil_book_collection	The eastern nations are renowned as centres of learning and enlightenment, creating some of the earliest universities. Although institutions such as the Platonic Academy existed in Greece hundreds of years before, these new centres of learning were more philosophical clubs than schools per se. For instance, the Sassanid Academy of Gondishapur and the Persian School of Nisibis, as well as the Pandidakterion in Constantinople, are widely regarded as the world's first universities. Gondishapur became such a centre of medical learning that many scholars credit it as the birthplace of the modern hospital system. The 'House of Wisdom', also, established in the late 8th century AD in Baghdad, became a repository of knowledge and progressive thinking, and as such attracted many scholars and intellectuals to creating a melting pot of ideologies. As a result, the House of Wisdom became, by the ebbing of the 10th century, the largest library in the world.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_military_militia	In their original form, militias were simply warriors who adhered to the principles of combat. However, over time they evolved from their Roman roots to mean part-time military forces used for the defence of cities or towns. Before the centralisation of government and the military in the later Middle Ages, noblemen from individual provinces were responsible for fielding troops during wartime, and also the militias that remained behind. The Emirate armies of Cordoba relied on Berber and Andalusian natives for their militias - the veterans of the Syrian garrisons were better suited to forming the core of the emir's standing armies. The Anglo-Saxon system of 'fyrd' and 'select' recruitment perfectly encapsulates the notion of armies and militias during this period - those who did not get drafted into the army to fight their king's wars stayed behind to make their villages safe. Redoubts were strengthened, militias formed, and barricades erected so settlements were fully prepared should the war come to them.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_military_cavalry_masters	Historical reports of cavalry usage during the Carolingian era vary, yet some historians suggest that horsepower was more prominent than originally thought, and that Byzantine writings have muddied our understanding. However, and the horse was a prized commodity on the battlefield, and did not appear in abundance. The aristocratic classes of warrior still rode, as they could afford the expensive animal and the necessary equipment, but most members of Frankish armies were not nobles. Shock cavalry was perhaps even more of a rarity, with whatever cavalry divisions were available mainly used as raiding and ambushing forces. There is also some debate over how many of the 35,000 cavalry attested to in the records of bannum and lantweri summons were genuine cavalry specialists, as opposed to 'mounted infantry'. Mounted infantry units could move quickly across the battlefield, but more importantly TO the battlefield - Charlemagne's speedy conquest of Europe was due in part to his use of horses to shuttle infantry to the front lines, where they would dismount and fight on foot.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_hereditary_monachy	The notion of hereditary monarchy, whereby the crown is passed down to the eldest male heir of a royal family, was a concept quite alien to the new kingdoms of Europe. Their barbarian culture was rooted in leading through strength, and dynastic disputes arose when stronger candidates initiated struggles for the crown. In Ostrogothic Italy, Theoderic left his son-in-law, Eutharic, as his heir. However, Eutharic's death left Theoderic's baby grandson as king, requiring a regent to rule in his stead until he came of age. Though his mother Amalasuntha became regent, the political situation had already become untenable and Theoderic's hard-fought legacy was undone by a violent power struggle. In Vandalic Africa, hereditary monarchy was more successful, as all the kingdom's rulers were of the same family and the crown passed successfully between them as each successive king died. It was the Vandalic kingdom's policies, rather than external bids for power, that caused its ultimate collapse.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_roman_ethic	The advent of Christianity across the Roman Empire under Constantine and later Emperors brought with it a shift in the perception of its ethical obligations. The power of the church in Rome became such that, if a bishop or Synod disagreed with the Emperor's ecclesiastical decisions, he could, somewhat dangerously, be declared a heretic. For the Emperor Constantine, at least, the notion that he was awarded victory in battle by the 'God of the Christians' began to dictate Imperial policy and granted the church greater power. The ethic of the Roman Empire tilted, therefore, to follow the ideal of a leader who believed that he was to unite not only Rome, but the entire world under the one God. 	true
technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_decentralised_state	Traditionally, the empires and nations of antiquity ruled from a central hub of power; a ruling class or royal family, in charge of everything below them. All aspects of the Roman Republic and, later, the Empire were controlled centrally, from the city of Rome itself. However, a decentralisation of power occurred as late antiquity progressed. As a result, the Roman Empire became increasingly bureaucratic and non-linear - the phrase "Byzantine bureaucracy" refers to the almost maddening  amount of red tape generated. Over the centuries, due to the Empire's vast size, provinces were gradually given greater and greater levels of autonomy, transferring much of the decision-process to local government. A similar system was used in the Vandal Kingdom, where Gelimer allowed loyal retainers to control individual regions, something that was to be his eventual undoing; their eventual rebellion against his oppression of Nicene Christians attracted the machinations of Emperor Justinian.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_elite_military_class	From time immemorial, Germanic barbarian society was built on a class system that placed those with strength and military prowess at its highest levels. Warriors occupied an exulted position, between the nobility and ordinary freemen. Entry into the warrior class required the candidate to be accepted into the retinue of an established warrior; those who fought well and gained prestige could hope to command a warband of their own one day. Although this basic military hierarchy remained essentially unchanged, the expansion of the Empire and the chaos of the Migration Period that followed – where many Germanic peoples spent almost the whole time on the move or on campaign - led to the fusion of warrior bands into permanent military units that stayed together all year round - living, practicing combat, and fighting side-by-side. Over time, they began to become almost indistinguishable from the regional, specialised Roman units, and armies as a whole took on the character of the Roman army.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_military_horse_masters	A source of food, a symbol of wealth, a beast of burden and a tool of war, the horse was one of the most versatile commodities in the ancient world. Equus ferus’ role was tied to its physical form – the small, early horse could only be used to pull primitive chariots. Larger, faster horses were later bred and used by skirmishers to chase down troops, but it was not until the development of more muscular breeds that shock troops such as the cataphracts came into being. Their long lances and heavy armour made these new-style heavy cavalry units deadly against infantry, fundamentally changing the nature of warfare forever. The racing of horses for sport went hand in hand with their military use, and of course provided useful training for both rider and animal.	true

They continued to practice votive offerings, depositing items at sacred places to gain the grace of the gods, or to ask favours of them, even vengeance. Pagans worshipped the natural world and the spirits of the land, with whom they tried to communicate by casting offerings into the water or burying them for the earth to claim. Even upon their grudging conversion to Christianity, in the late first century, peoples such as the Saxons continued to practice paganism, using gold and precious substances to gain the favour of the One God, or perhaps more duplicitously to appear as if that was the case.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_standardisation_of_the_military	The Roman military changed many of its organisational and logistical systems during late antiquity. For the first time since the early Republic, an annual conscription was placed on the populace, as well as a doubling of the number of armies (though with dramatically less men in each one). The increased drafting of tribal warriors into the military also meant a better template for Imperial military operations was required. During the late period of the Roman Empire, and therefore among the barbarian kingdoms that followed it, a standardisation of equipment and weaponry took place by using factories to mass-produce the required items. Inevitably, this meant a gradual reduction in quality of the items produced - something which reduced the army's effectiveness, along with less-rigorous training and drill.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_heavy_cavalry_tactics	As the Roman Empire divided and struggled into late antiquity, one of the chief problems its army had to address was its cavalry, which was greatly inferior compared to that of its enemies. The Hunnic and barbarian hordes that swept down from the steppes did so on horseback, and to the east the Sassanid armies smashed their foes apart with decisive heavy cataphracts. Rome was slow to adapt to the changing face of mounted warfare, as their chief allies primarily fielded foot soldiers. The Eastern Roman Empire, particularly, developed the clibinarii based on the eastern cataphracts, as a response to the threat posed by the unstoppable Sassanid charge. There is some debate amongst historians as to when cavalry achieved superiority over infantry, beginning the paradigm shift leading to the eventual rise of mounted knights and their dominance of the battlefield. Many believe it started at the Battle of Adrianople when the power of the Gothic heavy cavalry swept the Romans' heavy infantry from the field. However, many centuries passed before the medieval knights' spectacular war-winning combination of heavy horse and armour became the norm. 	true

Tools of bronze (then iron) enabled the land to be cultivated, ships to be built, stone to be quarried, and wars to be fought with increasing brutality and a terrible savagery. As antiquity subsided into the Middle Ages, blacksmiths remained ubiquitous: every village and town of note had a smithy turning out anything the community needed. Smithing also encouraged trade, as the iron needed to create steel was not always a local resource. Iron gave warriors an edge in combat, often quite literally; it allowed weapons and armour of greater strength to be forged.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_adominito_generalis	Charlemagne had a strong desire to reform throughout his reign. In particular, he focused much of his effort on educational and ecclesiastical reform, once calling himself the "new Josiah", another who was famed for his religious reforms. Charlemagne intended to further his primary goal of converting all of Europe to Christianity, and so focused on the "correction", as he called it, of discipline and moral in the Church's leadership. Priests intoned the Lord's prayer, the Creed, the Trinity and the Incarnation, relying less on frivolities of speech and real-world examples, as you might expect from a modern-day sermon. The bishops were instructed to see to it that these reforms occurred so, in doing so, the entire clergy would set an example for the people. Charlemagne's reforms went hand-in-hand with his other main focus, education, as laid down in his 'Charter of Modern Thought'. The Charter instructed local churches to give the boys in their congregation a basic education in reading and writing, and to do it free of charge.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_kings_court	The courts of barbarian kings and warlords were markedly different from the more 'civilised' courts and palaces of the Franks or the Muslim caliphates. For instance, built atop the tradition of tribal communes and chieftain's feasting halls, the courts and councils of Saxon and Viking kings were often places of revelry, where feasting and celebrating took place. The king also called together chieftains to meet in a gathering known as a 'thing' (in the Nordic countries) or a 'folkmoot' (in Anglo-Saxon ones). This was a place where grievances could be aired and issues of general policy and direction could be discussed.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_masters_terrain	One of the cornerstones of strategy is an understanding of the best place to fight a battle. Sun Tzu, in his 'Art of War', spends an entire chapter on the significance of terrain, and though he may have been unknown in the western Middle Ages, the tenets of his work are universally understood. Throughout history, examples clearly show that knowledge of the land confers innumerable benefits. The ambush at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, for instance, overwhelmed the Roman Legions as they traversed through unknown terrain, whilst the Cherusci forces under Arminius knew the topography intimately, and were able to hound the Imperial forces to complete annihilation. Likewise, the 8th century kingdoms of the northern British Isles selected the best strategic locations on which to build their defensive burhs - sites were selected that deliberately crossed paths and towns the enemy would have to traverse and capture to attain victory.	true

Such was the case with Carthage which, despite the decisive defeat of the Vandals at Ad Decimum, delivered the city to Belisarius in a state unfit to be defended. The general, therefore, undertook a rapid but rigorous task of repairing the fortifications of the city. He saw the ramparts reinforced, a more comprehensive ditch dug, and the wall's defensive vulnerabilities eliminated. Such was the speed and effectiveness of the repairs that local Moorish tribes soon professed allegiance to Belisarius, and disavowed the Vandals, under Gelimer, completely.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_diplomatic_trade_tribute	Trade between China and the eastern kingdoms was extremely important to the Persian, Arabian, and Aksumite economies. There were three main routes along this “Silk Road” from the Far East: the northern route, which passed through Persia to the Levant and was the source of much Sassanid wealth; the southern route, which involved negotiating the Karakoram mountains, through the Hindu Kush and into Baktria before heading west; the southwestern route, which went down through India before switching to ships (in order to avoid the scorching, inhospitable Arabian desert), sailing around the Horn of Africa and up into the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. This meant that even places such as Himyar and Aksum gained access to Chinese goods, and led to the exchange of cultural ideas and religious beliefs between China, African and Arabia – Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and Buddhism all spread across the Eurasian world in this manner. Of course, it was imperative that the route itself remain open as long as possible, so much effort was expended to keep it free of banditry and ensure that travellers along it were able to get fresh provisions, somewhere to stay, and most of all remained alive for the duration of their highly lucrative journeys.       	true

This often led to infighting and, in the case of the Visigoths, civil war. It wasn’t until Euric became king that he was able to defeat many of the powerful chieftains and unite them under one leader. With this new found power, Euric expanded the bounds of his territory into Hispania; by the time of the Western Roman Empire's collapse he had taken control of most of the Iberian Peninsula, all except Galatia. On his death the Visigoths also controlled around a third of Gaul, although they eventually lost all their holdings in the south of the country due to the relentless expansion of the neighbouring Frankish Empire.	true
technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_defence_in_depth	'Defence in Depth' is a theory held amongst some historians that Roman defensive military strategy evolved in the 4th century AD from the previous ideology of 'preclusive defence'. Preclusive defence was Rome's method of neutralising incursions by stationing units along its border, as well as in forward outposts, to trap enemy forces that came between them in a pincer movement. However, Roman borders became too vast to defend properly in this manner; limitanei couldn't hope to successfully defend fortifications until comitatenses swept in from outlying regions to neutralise the threat. This led to the development of defence in depth, a technique whereby the enemy army is given some ground over a large area, weakening its supply logistics as it spreads itself too thinly. Then, its weaker positions are attacked by the defending army, with the intention of repelling the enemy back to its original position - outside the boundaries the strategy was intended to defend. Defence in depth was common in late antiquity, when Rome's Western Empire became too ungainly, and among the barbarian kingdoms that succeeded it, in order to maintain their new-found and hard-won frontiers.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_military_berber_training	In the past it was sometimes deemed necessary to supplement trained forces with a levy of largely untrained men, usually to pin down or distract the enemy sufficiently for the professional troops to outflank them. In times of need, levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army - whether citizens or subjects. Many armies were created by command of the king, who ordered his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. The nobles or local dignitaries brought their households, attendant warriors, and levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_religious_advisors	As the desert kingdoms abandoned polytheism, religious figures emerged who became powerful, not only within their faiths, but also within political circles. For instance, Frumentius, a Tyrene slave who went on to become the first Bishop of Aksum, influenced the politics of the region even before he was ordained. As a civil servant, he first converted King Ezana to Christianity and later was regent to the Aksumite crown prince after Ezana's death. During this time he granted Christians religious freedom and, after being ordained and establishing a Holy See, became known as "Abuna" ("Our Father") amongst his congregation. Such was Frumentius' renown and importance to Aksumite politics, future kings refused Roman requests to replace him with someone they felt would better serve Imperial interests.	true

In the military, hereditary service was resumed to bring more people into its ailing ranks, whilst in the civilian sector the attraction of 'collegia' (legal associations) for workforces drew children to follow in their parent's footsteps. Hereditary craftsmanship was common as a child would, unless taught otherwise, learn the profession of his father, and then in turn pass that knowledge to his own children.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_distribution_of_precious_gifts	Power always was a fickle partner, and no less so in antiquity. The warrior-led societies of ancient Europe were based primarily on the strength of the individual. Much like Attila's empire in the east, western barbarian kingdoms were held together by the passion and power of their leader. A weak man could be toppled by stronger claimants to his throne. However, there were several ways a leader could maintain power. Victory in battle could help ensure he was feared and respected in equal measure; a man who gained glory on the battlefield was more likely to keep the support of his people. A ruler battered by military defeats would be seen as weak and, more importantly, vulnerable to usurpation by a stronger claimant. Power through law and religion was another way to gain and maintain strength. If the king was also the arbiter in all matters - even meting out 'divine justice' then his power extended to the lowest man, helping to reinforce his position further. Of course, loyalty could also be bought with cold, hard bribery; the distribution of prestigious gifts guaranteed the dedication of subordinate chiefs, at least temporarily. There is even evidence of industries dedicated to the production of prestige items, primarily for barbarian kings to purchase loyalty. Of particular value were those items of Roman design, which linked their owners to the resplendence of Imperial Rome.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_water_power	Before the advent of industrial mechanisation and electric power, harnessing the power of flowing water was the most effective method of generating energy for industry and agriculture. Water wheels and mills were known to have been used throughout ancient Rome and India, whereby the flow of a river (or, in Medieval times, the tide) turns gears and belts to generate power for irrigation. A process known as 'hushing' was developed during the 1st century AD and had been widely adopted by the dawn of the Middle Ages. Hushing is the deliberate and targeted use of torrents of water to wash away layers of soil and debris around seams so that they could be mined, with a sluice gate opened to control the strength of the water flow. In an era before explosives, hushing was an excellent method of revealing the minerals and wealth of the earth - and is still used to some extent in cases where explosives are deemed too destructive to the area being mined.	true

In particular, the 'tremisses' - valued at a third of a gold solidus - was used extensively until the late 7th century AD, when the advent of the silver standard created the English 'sceat'. Sceat were small, thick coins made entirely of silver, and decorated with a wide variety of impressive artworks of Celtic, Germanic and pagan designs, like animals, crosses and many scenes of nature.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_the_barbarian_code	When the Germanic peoples, chiefly the Vandals and various shades of Goth, settled in Italy and Gaul from the 5th century AD, they gradually began to adopt many of the trappings of 'civilisation'. Nothing if not practical, kings and their freeman warriors took the existing administrative structure and legal framework and adapted it for their own use. Previously, legal precedents were required to be held in advocates' - called 'rachimburgs' by the Franks - memories, leading to wildly inconsistent and subjective judgements. Whereas these tribal traditions of oral advocacy worked for a culture constantly on the move, now they had settled tribal laws were adapted to serve the people as a whole, rather than merely resolving conflicts between individuals. As it happened, the barbarians had inherited an administrative system that had been in place for many years, during which many of its peculiarities had been worked out. This made it simpler to 'Germanise' existing Roman laws and 'Latinise' elements of their own at the same time, in the process codifying everything within a single document. Written in Latin, the 'Codex Euricianus', or 'Code of Euric' was probably the first record of its kind; produced around AD480, it is a set of legal rulings and precedents compiled on the orders of the Visigothic king Euric II, who ruled parts of northern Spain and southern France around Toulouse during the 5th century AD. This legal landmark was swiftly followed by the publication of the Frankish 'Lex Salica', around AD500, and the  'Lex Romana Visigothorum', or 'Breviary of Alaric', in AD506. 	true

By the 4th century AD barbarian kings could no longer rely on voluntary support to fuel their military campaigns, forcing them to look elsewhere for the finances to raise and support their armies. For many barbarian peoples, their most lucrative assets were agricultural, making farms an obvious target for additional taxation in times of need. Both the Alemanni and Tervingi tribes are known to have levied taxes on agricultural production to pay for the support of their armies.	true

For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before.

technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_improved_siege_engines	The established norms of siege warfare changed during the Middle Ages. The same general principles of starvation and destruction applied, but as cities became larger and more fortified, the method of cracking these increasingly daunting defences also had to adapt. The onager and ballista were still common sights in a siege engineer's arsenal, but so too were newer, more adventurous weapons like the trebuchet and mangonel. Enormous, beam-sling weapons that hurled rocks (or whatever the general chose - even enemy prisoners!) in gigantic arcs before releasing them, created enormous amounts of force with which the attacker hoped to smash down walls or fire over them to destroy the city beyond. However, not always were these weapons the key to victory - at the Siege of Pavia in AD773-4, Charlemagne failed to bring siege equipment to his assault on the Lombard capital, and so the Frankish king was forced to starve the city out. This, combined with a Lombard failure to adequately prepare for the siege, resulted in their capitulation in June of AD774 - such tried and tested methods of old rarely fail, it seems.	true

This happened at Carthage, and then again after he seized Rome. In Rome, the general found himself partially surrounded by Gothic forces, who cut the water supply from the aqueducts to prevent them from powering the city's mills in an attempt to starve him out. Yet Belisarius had a plan for harnessing the power of the River Tiber by placing millstones in small boats so the force of the rapids kept them turning. The subsequent survival of the mills was inextricably linked to the city's survival and, ultimately, victory for Belisarius.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_east_civil_codification_of_laws	In AD429, Theodosius II and his co-Emperor, Valentinian III, enacted a commission to unify classical Roman law with their more modern Imperial legislature. The 'Codex Theodosianus', as it was known, took 22 experts nine years to pull together across sixteen volumes, and represented the majority of Rome's legal framework, codified for first time since the foundation of the 'Twelve Tables'. It was not without problems, however. The Codex was hard to properly research, with laws changing even as they were being written. Delays in acquiring information from Rome, Ravenna and private collections made editing it a frustrating process. Nevertheless, the Codex represented a major breakthrough in the documentation of Roman legal processes. It also increased state authority on religious matters, expanding on Christianity's decriminalisation under Constantine and solidly positioning it as Rome's official state religion; one that was intrinsically linked to the role of Emperor.	true

Therefore, in the name of variety, eastern cavalry took many forms. As a result short swordsmen, light skirmishers and archers were all used, but the primary, most effective weapon was the lance, particularly amongst the cataphract elite. The kontos was a wooden lance, roughly four metres in length, and was much stronger than contemporary Roman and Hellenistic lances. According to Plutarch, the strength of the lance and the power the rider put behind it meant that, purportedly, it could even skewer two men at once.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_organisation_of_production	The skill of Roman craftsmen is well known due to artefacts that have been discovered during excavations, and through surviving written works of the time. Through careful study, these sources have illuminated the field of Roman craftsmanship in late antiquity, marked by a gradual decline in artisanship and a movement towards very primitive forms of mass production. Although many in the Empire maintained their ancient craft and production methods, the eastern fabricae – the forerunner of the factory, in which a great deal of weapons and armour were made at a quality ostensibly less than that of a premier smith – gradually took over from individuals designing and making unique, bespoke pieces to order. The results speak for themselves.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_tax_farming	The Roman government, burdened as it was with the myriad tasks of running an Empire, sometimes reassigned duties (such as tax collection) to the private sector - a process known as 'revenue leasing' or 'tax farming'. These contractors were known as 'publicans' and, in addition to their tax and duty collections, they also oversaw building projects and the supply of the Roman military. Although more efficient for its central administration, revenue leasing was widely abused in the Roman Empire, as publicans became very wealthy from the interest they retained from collected taxes. The collapse of the Western Empire, in part, is attributed to this corruption, but it didn't end there; the same tax collection infrastructure remained in place when the Ostrogoths took control.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_involuntary_levy	In the ancient world, it was sometimes deemed necessary to supplement trained forces with a levy of largely untrained men, usually to pin down or distract the enemy sufficiently for the professional troops to outflank them. In times of need, levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army whether citizens or subjects. Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, they supplemented the elite professional soldiers. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true
technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_land_and_community_laws	Ancient barbarian society was built on agriculture, so naturally many of its laws dealt with this important aspect of life. Clearly identifying the boundaries between farmland was paramount, so boundary pillar stones were erected to demarcate the edges of people's property. The idea was that their presence would cut down the amount of land disputes that occurred, as moving the pillars to a more favourable position was very much a Herculean task. In Ireland, Cormac mac Cuileannanin’s ‘Sanas Chormaic’ called them ‘gallan,’ as they were first erected by the Gauls when they arrived there. This type of stone has also been found in England and Scotland, often with names engraved on them in ‘Ogham' script.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_military_citizens_defence	There is no denying that the Carolingian Franks, and even the Merovingian kings before them, created a militarised society in an attempt to forge a European power equal to the might of once-great Rome. Every aspect of feudal society was made combat ready, from the elite aristocracy with heavy horse and armour - proto-knights - to the land-working peasants, drafted by regional magnates into fighting for their king and their homes. Those not called to be part of a standing army remained in their villages and were expected to be able to fight in their defence. Regional lords and magnates established their own defences; watchtowers and fortifications built atop the old bastions of Rome. One such fortification was at Carcassonne - an old Roman redoubt that the Bellonid dynasty, rulers of the province, further fortified during the Carolingian age. Whilst some of those charged with defending the city beyond would have been privately funded, armed peasantry from the surrounding area would doubtless have been made to do their part.	true

technologies_long_description_att_celtic_celtic_warrior_culture	Battle was an integral part of Celtic culture in the ancient world. Tribes frequently fought the neighbouring Germanic, Nordic, and nomadic peoples, each other, the Greeks and, above all others, the expansionist, imperialist Romans. Amongst themselves, Celtic tribes fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class or two nominated champions facing off in single combat. Neighbouring, rival tribes raided each other’s territory almost as sport, rather than as a serious, organised attempt to expand their boundaries. For the would-be warrior displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status within the tribe. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids from the age of fourteen upward. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true
technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_certificates_and_seals	Trade from China, and later India, formed one of the key pillars of Sassanid wealth. Trade along the Silk Road from China was largely controlled by the Sassanids, allowing them to keep goods coming from Rome, thereby enhancing their power. The silks and spices that flowed from further east were used as bartering tools, diplomatic tributes and even as pay for soldiers. Trade goods of a particularly high quality were marked with 'bullae' - clay seals that denoted that they had been bought, paid for, and were in perfect condition for transport. These bullae indicated that trade was an efficient, organised effort, justifying the premiums the Sassanids levied on their eastern partners.	true
technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_mercenary_exploitation	In the ancient world manpower was always a serious problem. In order to raise and prepare an army quickly - so it could effectively face a looming threat - it was often necessary to hire mercenaries to fulfil specific battlefield functions. Often, they would be hired locally – the idea being that local knowledge and familiarity with the terrain could be useful to the commanding general. However, the experiences Western Roman Empire proved that it was not wise to rely on mercenaries of the same ethnic group as the opposing army – generals could not bank on their loyalty, despite having paid for their services. A wise general would recruit, from further afield and in small numbers, men with no connection or vested interest in the military situation at hand, largely eliminating the possibility that personal loyalties may complicate what was supposed to be a purely financial transaction.	true
technologies_long_description_att_slav_civil_advanced_agriculture_antes	The Slavs, as a mobile, 'barbarian' culture, were particularly capable farmers - far better, as the Roman Emperor Maurice stated, than "savage warriors". Indeed, he said that they had "an abundance of all kinds of animals and agricultural produce". Archaeological evidence shows a development of Slavic agricultural technology throughout late antiquity. This led to a surplus of supplies that allowed them to thrive and grow. The transient, on-the-move nature of the Slavic tribes also benefited their endeavours - in new areas, they would burn down forests to make room for fields. The ash created was then used as a potent fertiliser. The Slavs would also settle, whenever possible, along valley beds where the soil was fertile and water abundant. Once they had tilled the soil until it was unworkable they would then move somewhere else, allowing the forests to reclaim the used land. However, over time, the Slavs developed a system of crop rotation, allowing some of the fields to lie fallow (ploughed, but not sowed) to restore their fertility. This allowed the land to be worked for much longer, and reduced the need for tribes to relocate. 	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_leadership_police	Before the rise of Attila, who eventually became king of all the Huns, the Hunnic nation was run by several leaders, with one chief 'king' of them all. These leaders were all semi-independent yet internally ranked against one another. Over time they vanished and an authoritarian, dictatorial system emerged as Attila, at first co-ruling with his brother, Bleda, forged a Hunnic empire. Attila's rule was based primarily on intimidation of every tribe and people he encountered, maintaining power and control over them through terror. The ceaseless savagery Attila inflicted upon those who opposed him served as a warning to others, even forcing super powers such as the Eastern Romans to acquiesce to his diplomatic demands. In order to facilitate this strategy, Attila surrounded himself with various aides and chiefs from other cultures, using them as spies. He kept control of his empire by knowing his enemy's moves and keeping his subjects in check through fear, power and controlling access to information and knowledge. Attila's dictatorial control was so great that its survival was tied almost entirely to him - when he died, the fractures were almost immediate, as lesser tribes supplanted his leadership with their own local leaders, breaking his Hunnic empire apart.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_military_defensive_logistical_expenditure	An army can live off the land in most places. What can’t be found, stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried with it: arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load, medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable as opposed to just plain miserable. Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or exhausted. He will not give his best in such circumstances, no matter how inspiring the leadership qualities of his commanders.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_civil_feudalism	With the collapse of the Roman Empire, the Europe of the Middle Ages evolved the Roman villa system into three elements; the feudal system, manorialism and serfdom. Feudalism divided the king's land into territories (or 'fiefs'), which were ruled by vassals in his name. Most of the land in Carolingian Europe was held 'allodially', meaning the  vassal was vested with total control and (importantly) defence of the land in the name of the king. Manorialism legitimised the power they had, as the manor became the centre of local legal and economic authority. The lord of the manor became the most important local figure, his subjects tasked with working the land surrounding his castle. At the bottom of this system (often represented by a triangle with the king at the apex) were the serfs, who were made to work in a system only slightly removed from slavery. The serfs farmed for their own gain, but owed their masters a share of the produce that was grown. They were totally dependant on the lord's land to work, and were legally bound never to leave his service.	true

Tribes frequently fought the neighbouring Germanic, Nordic, Celtic, and nomadic peoples, and even amongst themselves. Inter-tribal battles were generally fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class. Neighbouring rivals raided each other’s territory almost as sport, rather than as a serious, organised attempt to expand their boundaries. On the other hand, the wild Norsemen did so because their land couldn't produce the agricultural yields needed to feed their growing population, eventually settling in places such as England and France, where the conditions were more favourable.

technologies_long_description_bel_roman_military_military_regionalisation	It was Constantine the Great who, in the 4th century AD, reformed the Roman army from the system that had been in place since the 2nd. In many ways, Constantine built on the initiatives of earlier Emperors such as Gallienus and even Severus, more clearly defining the roles of the standing Imperial army, and increasing its overall size significantly. The reforms established firm roles, such as comitatenses and limitanei - roaming armies and frontier troops respectively. This, in conjunction with the general reduction in size of individual Imperial armies, indicated Constantine's trend of creating specialised function, also shown in the specific names of units such as lanciarii, clibinarii and balistarii. It also promoted regionalisation, as limitanei forces dug in at their locations like a garrison, whereas the smaller comitatenses armies would deploy as needed to provinces throughout the Empire. Constantine's reforms further delineated the previously homogenous approach, instead creating smaller clusters that reduced his armies' logistical cost; each force was sent only where it was needed, reducing frivolous expenditure and placing it nearer to necessary production facilities.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_military_regimentation_of_military_equipment	Before the reforms of Khosrow I, military equipment was generally provided by the soldiers themselves. As the Sassanid standing army was drawn mainly from the upper aristocracy, money was no object and equipping horse and rider was simple. With Khosrow's military shakeup, however, things changed. With the newly emerged lower nobility, the Dekhan, now able to enlist, their equipment and training was provided by the central government. The Shahanshah enforced 'equipment lists' when mustering to ensure all soldiers were correctly geared. Armaments were also stored during peacetime, ready for immediate distribution when hostilities commenced. In this way, an army was created that was capable of deploying faster and fighting longer on multiple fronts. When the Shahanshah did call his satraps to war, men would rally from all corners of the empire, each bringing their regional individualities. Over time, a level of regimentation emerged, with standardisation of heavy armour for nobility and horse archers. The numerous light horse archers, in the Parthian style, became more organised with standardised armour and bows. The individual style of regional forces remained, but the organisation of the Sassanid war machine greatly improved.	true
technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_military_foreign_siege_methods	Sieges in late antiquity were varied affairs - they either ended in a short, bloody battle, or settled into protracted situations of more devious strategies and classic blockade warfare. For the defenders, they were often secure in the knowledge that an enemy assault on the walls would be easy for them to repel. On the other hand, attackers knew that starving out the defenders may take time but would likely result in ultimate victory. However, it was only after increased contact with the enemy that they truly learned. Roman technologies bled across to the Sassanids, and vice versa, as is demonstrated through the Roman use of the 'Clibinarii' - a developed form of cataphract, which in turn became the standard across the ancient world. Roman siege techniques also took hold in Sassanid Persia as Roman urban warfare developed. The Persians also kept secret supply networks and vast stores of food in preparation for drawn-out assaults. Many of these systems went unnoticed, allowing their armies to outlast the enemy on each occasion. 	true
technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_warrior_ideals	Battle was an integral part of Dark Age 'barbarian' culture. Tribes frequently fought the neighbouring Germanic, Nordic, Celtic, and nomadic peoples, and even amongst themselves. Inter-tribal battles were generally fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class. Neighbouring rivals raided each other’s territory almost as sport, rather than as a serious, organised attempt to expand their boundaries. On the other hand, the wild Norsemen did so because their land couldn't produce the agricultural yields needed to feed their growing population, eventually settling in places such as England and France, where the conditions were more favourable.

technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_wooden_wall	As society developed, the need for larger settlements to house more people increased. This gave rise to fortified settlements, which tended to be built on areas with natural defences such as hilltops, cliffs or river bank with stone or wooden defences added, which set them apart from smaller tribal settlements. Some historians argue that the addition of fortifications was not a defensive decision but was, in fact, a matter of prestige.	true
technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_protected_grazing_rights	'Nomad' peoples followed the seasons with their herds, rather than having a settled agricultural lifestyle. The word itself is a Greek term and, as might be expected of the civilised, settled Greeks, they did not approve of barbarous nomads in the slightest. Nomads, on the other hand, may not have had permanent settlements, but their lives were as full and rich as settled farmer or city dwellers and probably healthier too, as they didn’t live in squalor. Nomadism is an extremely effective way of living off areas with scarce natural resources, such as the steppes. With their herds of domesticated animals nomadic tribesmen travel from camp to camp following the seasons and the grazing they need to maintain. As such, they rely on sheep and goats to provide meat, milk, hides and wool as the basis of their entire way of life. As grazing is exhausted, the herds can be moved on and the land left to recover until the following year. Despite lacking the supposed benefits of a settled community, the ancient nomads could nevertheless prosper. With fearsome warriors among their numbers, they were not above 'foraging' by raiding nearby settlements and farms! This was also an extremely effective and ruthless way of raising troops. The easiest way of harvesting scarce resources is, of course, to take them from someone else. The tribe who could not protect their own livestock, property and kin soon ceased to exist. This also encouraged the worst feature of nomad life for neighbouring, settled peoples: nomads will raid and steal from weak, sedentary folk because they are just another resource to be exploited. 	true

With this new found power, Euric expanded the bounds of his territory into Hispania; by the time of the Western Roman Empire's collapse he had taken control of most of the Iberian Peninsula, all except Galatia. On his death the Visigoths also controlled around a third of Gaul, although they eventually lost all their holdings in the south of the country due to the relentless expansion of the neighbouring Frankish Empire.	true

The onager and ballista were still common sights in a siege engineer's arsenal, but so too were newer, more adventurous weapons like the trebuchet and mangonel. Enormous, beam-sling weapons that hurled rocks (or whatever the general chose - even enemy prisoners!) in gigantic arcs before releasing them, created enormous amounts of force with which the attacker hoped to smash down walls or fire over them to destroy the city beyond. However, not always were these weapons the key to victory - at the Siege of Pavia in AD773-4, Charlemagne failed to bring siege equipment to his assault on the Lombard capital, and so the Frankish king was forced to starve the city out. This, combined with a Lombard failure to adequately prepare for the siege, resulted in their capitulation in June of AD774 - such tried and tested methods of old rarely fail, it seems.	true

Although camels were generally used for trade - carrying goods across the desert - and in army baggage trains, they were also adapted for war - the presence of camel cavalry in eastern armies was noted as early as 853BC. The Arabian Bedouin tribe selectively bred their horses for speed, strength, and endurance, so they were capable of both long-distance travel and calm obedience on the battlefield, becoming renowned throughout the world for their strength and reliability in battle, something which couldn't be said of some western breeds.	true

The infamous, deadly Parthian Shot – which confounded opponents by appearing to be a retreat until the very final moment, the widespread use of arrows and javelins to skirmish and harass, and the terrifying armoured charge of the mounted cataphracts were all born from the unique topography and arid weather conditions found in the east. Furthermore, by the time of Sassanid Persia and Arab kingdoms such as the Lakhmids, all of these techniques had been in use for several centuries and had won many a battle – even against the well-drilled Roman Legions, who were defeated in detail and annihilated on several occasions as a result. 	true
technologies_long_description_bel_roman_military_mercenary_exploitation	Diocletian's military reforms ushered in many changes.

These reforms came at a time when Romans were becoming more and more cynical and reluctant towards the military, with a much-reduced rate of sign-ups despite the attractive wage. To combat this, the state implemented a series of recruitment measures, such as hereditary service and a compulsory levy for landowners. However, these strategies were only mildly effective. A more dangerous but common strategy was the recruitment of barbarians, often drawing on defeated enemies and those outside of the Empire to fill the otherwise sparse Roman ranks. For the Western Empire, this reliance was its undoing, as the unruly and displaced tribes took liberties that gradually eroded the Roman state. In the East, the Emperors kept a much tighter control on the balance of their armed forces, ensuring no single power could dominate the military.

As such, there is no historical evidence of any real Slavic mining activity. However, they did import large amounts of silver; unearthed burial sites have revealed the kinds of things the Slavs hoarded and sent with their dead to the grave. One discovered in Moldova contained myriad pieces of metalwork, including two silver spurs, a silver knife and an ornate silver fibula brooch. Other sites contained silver buttons and beads. Clearly, the Slavs put great importance on their valuable items - perhaps including them in graves as votive offerings for the gods. In order to make these items they became highly adept at working with silver and indeed Slavic silverwork has been found all over Europe, including in the graves of Vikings, who no doubt plundered it from someone else!	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_religious_courts	Traditionally, the eastern and desert kingdoms - like almost all others in the ancient world - placed great importance on the military prowess of their leaders, with legitimacy being accorded to victory in war and conquest being seen as the king's duty to his people; victory over weaker neighbours enabled kings to style themselves as stalwart protectors of their people, winning both hearts and minds at home. Likewise, being associated with the state religion and taking the counsel of senior religious officials was important for the same reasons, and in some places they were even given government positions with key responsibilities. Such a case is Frumentius, who became the first Bishop of Aksum – the closest advisor to King Ezana and the man responsible for his, and by extension Aksum’s, conversion to Christianity during the 4th century AD. 	true

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_military_chivalry	Before the concept of chivalry, those who wished to live a noble life of honour adhered to the unwritten code of 'noble habitus'. The habitus extolled the virtues of loyalty, mercy, strength, generosity and honour as key facets of the nobility. Many of its ideals were first postulated in the Song of Roland, an epic poem written about the decisive Battle of Roncevaux in AD778, when Charlemagne's rear guard were cut off and bravely fought to the last man to ensure their king's escape. In the poem, the character of Count Oliver, friend to the eponymous Roland, exemplifies the virtues of the habitus through his bravery, skill and wisdom; he is known as 'preudomme' - the ideal nobleman, forming the honourable bedrock upon which Medieval chivalry was later built.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_call_arms	If the collapse of the Roman Empire made one thing clear, it was that life would never – could never – be the same as it had been for centuries prior. The barbarian kingdoms that swept away Rome's remnants assumed much of its workable infrastructure, particularly that relating to the organisation of the armed forces. By offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, loyalty could be secured. The kingdoms of the late Dark and early Middle Ages were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to aspire to. Members were obligated to fight for the king and provide troops from their own retinues whenever he called them to do so. In return, they were given lands and titles under the proviso that they enforced the king's laws and offered protection to the peasants who worked their lands. In real terms, this was a license to behave in almost any way the vassals liked - they had the weapons and the training to make any point they so chose; the serfs, on the other hand, had none of those things, and therefore no chance to rise up and change their situation.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_organised_stock_rustling	The reason for Attila's conquest of Europe, and the avalanche of displacement he began, is theorised to have occurred for many possible reasons; climate change, transhumanism or the desire for conquest, yet his ambition cannot be seen as wholly culturally motivated. In fact, Attila embraced an even greater cultural tolerance than eastern nations like the Sassanids, who were accepting of all so long as their laws were obeyed. His aspirations were motivated by a desire for power, for riches and for living space for the Hunnic people. Therefore, those tribes that were amalgamated into his growing empire were welcomed, providing they did all that Attila asked of them. This tolerance of other cultures, combined with Attila's far-ranging conquests, meant cultural osmosis was inevitable as the Huns impacted on their clients and vice versa. For instance, from excavation it is impossible to tell the difference between tools fashioned by the Germanic and Hunnic cultures of the period. Further, the Huns came to learn the Germanic language out of necessity, as well as dress like their barbarian subjects, but that may have been due to the cold weather gripping Europe at the time. It indicates that the Hunnic empire became a fusion of the various steppe nomads and barbarian cultures it encompassed. The way to prosperity was clearly tied to the appropriation of Hunnic culture, and to make oneself as Hun-like as possible. The identity of a man, therefore, became a premium commodity; as the Germanic tribes that were the bulk of Attila's European army became Hunnic, the Huns in turn, became more European.	true

This was particularly true of lawmaking and judgement in civil and criminal cases in Islamic society. The Sassanids, who were the premier power in the near east before the Caliphate, considered law and religion intrinsic to each other; their god Zoroaster was the arbiter of justice who presided over legal affairs through his priesthood. Likewise, the law of the Caliphate considered religious and legal matters one and the same, and also controlled everyday practices such as fasting and hygiene. As a result, religion and society were bound together - with Islamic law thought to be the immutable word of God.	true
technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_supplant_government_officials	The notion of hereditary monarchy, whereby the crown is passed down to the eldest male heir of a royal family, was a concept quite alien to the new kingdoms of Europe. Their barbarian culture was rooted in leading through strength, and dynastic disputes arose when stronger candidates initiated struggles for the crown. In Ostrogothic Italy, Theoderic left his son-in-law, Eutharic, as his heir. However, Eutharic's death left Theoderic's baby grandson as king, requiring a regent to rule in his stead until he came of age. Though his mother Amalasuntha became regent, the political situation had already become untenable and Theoderic's hard-fought legacy was undone by a violent power struggle. In Vandalic Africa, hereditary monarchy was more successful, as all the kingdom's rulers were of the same family and the crown passed successfully between them as each successive king died. It was the Vandalic kingdom's policies, rather than external bids for power, that caused its ultimate collapse.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_exchange_of_expertise	There is a general assertion among historians that, by AD400, the barbarians’ pottery industry had died. Yet this is oversimplifying the situation somewhat; whilst it is true that specialised industries declined across the Roman Empire and beyond, there were some places where it endured. In Britannia, for example, the pottery industry all but evaporated as the Western Empire floundered. Places like Egypt, however, continued to produce specialised craftsmanship. In Gaul and the north of the Empire, the craftsmanship of previous centuries faded, however, and a more simplified form emerged; one which produced goods more for the sake of sale than skill. With this came a greater co-operation between individuals as craftsmen worked together, not in competition, but due to the shared (and very real) sense that the world was heading into decline. In doing so, individuals, and their families and communities, were able to survive.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_gatherings	Nights were long, cold, and dark on the steppes and in the forests of Europe. Bringing everyone in a group together around a large fire, sometimes in a large, communal hall, kept them warm and allowed hot meals to be shared, ensuring everyone got their fair share. This in turn engendered a sense of community, kept most predators at bay, and instilled a feeling of safety amongst the tribe members. In practice, a large fire was constructed in a circle, and everyone sat around it, talking, eating, drinking, and huddling together for warmth and companionship. Of course, communal spaces also served other important purposes. Stories were passed down from generation to generation this way; tribal histories and legends gradually melded together until they became one and the same. A gathering of the entire group also gave its leaders the opportunity to reveal their plans to everyone at once, and deal with any questions or concerns they may have.	true

Some were simply drafted, whilst others were told they were, essentially, 'on-call'. Unlike the Roman system of remuneration, Muslim armies were mostly paid in cash, though some land packages were also distributed. In doing so, they formed the basis upon which contemporary military systems still work, with armies very much dependant on the state to survive.	true

As the road became more trusted, it was used by diplomats and envoys to travel into Sassanid Persia. The goods that were brought along with these ambassadors, therefore, were considered as highly valuable diplomatic gestures. Silken fabrics and spices were chief amongst the tributes brought to kings and leaders, as a demonstration of good faith. Silk gained status as a quasi-currency in the ancient world, with it not only being used as a fabric and a diplomatic tool, but also as remuneration for soldiers and mercenaries when their service for the Shahanshah was done.	true

This could mean that the old ruler's brothers, uncles and even grandsons were all part of the succession. In order to claim and keep the crown the candidate had to prove himself to the people.

Whilst there would be a retinue of thegns to form an elite guard, the bulk of their armies had to come from elsewhere. The common folk of the country, known as the 'fyrd', were the answer. Levying freemen was a tradition from the Mercian's Germanic roots that had endured, and the fyrd fought if not for their king then for their home. Originally, all able-bodied freemen were expected to fight but it quickly became evident that whilst away from their homes, nobody could tend to crops or push the economy along, especially if a war became protracted. Likewise, if too many men died, there would be nobody to work the land when the war was over. From this, the Anglo-Saxons developed the 'select' system, where only certain men - those considered most able for the purpose - would be drafted into the army, whilst the rest would remain and see to the business of keeping the country, not just the army, going for the duration of hostilities.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_military_equipment_law	Before the reforms of Khosrow I, equipment was generally provided by the soldiers themselves. As the Sassanid standing army was drawn mainly from the upper aristocracy, money was no object and equipping horse and rider was simple. With Khosrow's military shakeup, however, things changed. With the newly emerged lower nobility, the Dekhan, now able to enlist, their equipment and training was provided by the central government. The Shahanshah enforced 'equipment lists' when mustering to ensure all soldiers were correctly geared. Armaments were also made and stored during peacetime in arsenals, ready for immediate distribution when hostilities commenced. In this way, an army was created that was capable of deploying faster and fighting longer on multiple fronts. When the Shahanshah did call his satraps to war, men would rally from all corners of the empire, each bringing their regional individualities. Over time, a level of regimentation emerged, with a standardisation emerging of heavy armour for nobility, but with caveats for archery. The numerous light horse archers, in the Parthian style, became more organised with standardised armour and bows. The individual style of regional forces remained, but the organisation of the Sassanid war machine greatly improved.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_local_traditions	The pagan tribes of Europe fought fiercely to defend their way of life against the encroaching tide of Christianity proselytised by the Byzantines and Charlemagne. They continued to practice votive offerings, depositing items at sacred places to gain the grace of the gods, or to ask favours of them, even vengeance. Pagans worshipped the natural world and the spirits of the land, with whom they tried to communicate by casting offerings into the water or burying them for the earth to claim. Even upon their grudging conversion to Christianity, in the late first century, peoples such as the Saxons continued to practice paganism, using gold and precious substances to gain the favour of the One God, or perhaps more duplicitously to appear as if that was the case.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_military_defence_depth	Decisive, pitched battles are not always the best option, especially if you are the outnumbered defender. As borders expanded faster than armies could grow, the idea of "preclusive defence" (a line of border forts and outposts to intercept incursions) became more difficult to maintain. "Defence in depth" was a new concept which allowed the enemy to conquer some ground, but spread them out thinly so they could be dealt with more easily. The defenders then closed around and harassed the weaker portions of the invading army, pushing them back to beyond the borders if not destroying them outright. This defensive strategy was further developed during the Middle Ages with the construction of hill forts and concentric castles, which drew the enemy invaders into layers of defences. Methods such as these exacted a heavy toll on attacking forces, as they repeatedly had to run a gauntlet of missile fire whilst scaling the walls.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_one_faith	Before Christianity, it was believed that the gods were responsible for every worldly and otherworldly happening. Investigation into more natural solutions revealed preliminary understanding of atomics, which fed into understanding of the elements. As the Romans conquered their philosophy expanded to become self-aggrandising; Rome conquered, thus Rome was right. Great edifices to their glory, and to the gods, were erected from concrete in impressively short timeframes. Christianity, and the notion of the Emperor's semi-divinity, later bolstered the self-absorbed notion of Roman philosophy and its outlook on the world -  the Emperor was charged with the task of uniting the world, in the name of God! This notion persisted among the barbarian kingdoms which followed the Empire, into the Middle Ages and beyond - the monarch was chosen by God himself to rule on His behalf. 	true
technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_blood_brotherhood	Blood oaths to demonstrate loyalty one to another are a common feature in many cultures. By sharing blood two warriors become symbolic brothers, and are expected to treat each other as family members in all respects. Unlike modern interpretations of blood oaths, where both individuals make cuts and press them together so that their blood mingles, the Scythian oath involved shedding of a blood into a cup. The men then drank the mingled blood and demonstrated their mutual loyalty as brothers. No man was allowed more than three blood brothers, if only to avoid any potential tangles in conflicting obligations to different people. The custom of drinking the blood also neatly side-stepped any transfer of blood-borne diseases from one man to another by direct cut-to-cut transfer.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_burhs	A 'burh' is the origin of what would become the borough and then later the town. They were created as a line of defence against enemies in England, specifically the Vikings, as Viking raids became more common during the 8th and 9th centuries AD. Although many burhs were built atop existing settlements (like the Roman settlement at York) and used Roman walls as defences, new fortifications were established at sites of strategic significance - on the coast, on high ground or defending trade routes. When constructed from nothing, the defenders would create a lattice of palisades and banks behind a large ditch to slow invaders down or impale them as they attempted to enter the burh. Although these sites became towns and cities in their own right later on, at this point in time they were often constructed as a line of defence for the more vulnerable lowlands, and the farmers who lived there.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_militia	In their original form, militias were simply warriors who adhered to the principles of combat. However, over time they evolved from their Roman roots to mean part-time military forces used for the defence of cities or towns. Before the centralisation of government and the military in the later Middle Ages, noblemen from individual provinces were responsible for fielding troops during wartime, and also the militias that remained behind. The Emirate armies of Cordoba relied on Berber and Andalusian natives for their militias - the veterans of the Syrian garrisons were better suited to forming the core of the emir's standing armies. The Anglo-Saxon system of 'fyrd' and 'select' recruitment perfectly encapsulates the notion of armies and militias during this period - those who did not get drafted into the army to fight their king's wars stayed behind to make their villages safe. Redoubts were strengthened, militias formed, and barricades erected so settlements were fully prepared should the war come to them.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_land_grants	In order to cement and legitimise their rule, the former 'barbarian' kingdoms sought to go further than merely adding a layer of their most prestigious people on top of the old Roman societal infrastructure. Alliances were forged and loyalty secured through intermarriage between ruling houses, a practice which continued right up to the modern age. Another way of maintaining stability was to 'buy' allegiances via the gifting of strategically-positioned territories, thus ensuring that potential rivals were placated and, rather more cynically, so 'buffer' states existed between the giver and any hostile powers. Initially all this was designed in order to present a united front against the Byzantine Romans – who would surely come to reclaim their former Empire in the west – but eventually was just a way of keeping the emergent royal houses in control of their kingdoms.	true

When the Goths became trapped in the northern Balkans in AD377 they recruited Huns and Alans to remove the Roman garrison that was blocking the passes of the Haemus Mons range. In return for saving the Goths from certain starvation, the steppe mercenaries were promised their fair share of plunder, an arrangement that pleased all involved, except for the Romans of course!	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_fixed_land_tax	Although the Sassanids had coins minted, they appear to have been used for much more ceremonial purposes, and when used as economic tools they fast became devalued and mixed with older Arsacid coins. The chief means of economic mobility was therefore primarily barter. In lieu of a strong fiscal motivation, taxation was based on crop-sharing and valuation of crop yields per annum. In addition to a tax on the land, a poll tax was brought against the people themselves, who although offered the option of paying in coin, would more than likely pay instead with goods and crops. Although the taxation system brought coin to the royal coffers, it was seen as inefficient and wasteful; it couldn't take into account fluctuations in land and agricultural yield, and therefore couldn't be planned in advance. It also put a very heavy burden on the common Sassanid peasant, yet all this was initially insignificant to the Shahanshah, who saw his coffers filled with taxed gold.	true

These aristocratic families provided wealth to field cavalry and, most notably, created the hammer blow of armies in the cataphracts. They also levied their own province's peasants to form an ill-equipped, poorly-trained infantry, who were little more than cannon fodder. Yet holes in the military machine still existed, and had to be plugged. Specifically, the lighter cavalry, as well as higher class infantry, were drawn from Sassanid allies such as the Khazars and the Dailamites.

Upon their conversion to Christianity many people simply adapted elements of pagan worship to their new faith.

These scripts were all 'abjad', meaning each symbol represents a consonant, with the reader having to assume the necessary vowel. The migratory nature of many of the Arabic tribes meant that, although specifics vary, the Arabic language spread across the Middle Eastern world, becoming the lingua franca for trade and religion, amongst other things.

They were intended as centres of literary, religious and civil learning, as opposed to simply teaching nobles the ways of war. For example, Charlemagne was determined to reform the Frankish Kingdom's educational system in favour of broader educational institutions, so that a greater proportion of his subjects could be educated. He did this by inviting Alcuin, a scholar from York, to his court at Aachen, along with Peter of Pisa and others. Alcuin became Charlemagne's 'prime minister of education' and held sway in all scholastic matters for the entire realm, as well as personally tutoring the king. Later, Charlemagne decreed the 'Charter of Modern Thought', with the view that every boy should be given a basic education, not just the sons of the noble elite.	true

By the 4th century AD barbarian kings could no longer rely on voluntary support to fuel their military campaigns, forcing them to look elsewhere for the finances to raise and support their armies. For many barbarian peoples, their most lucrative assets were agricultural, making farms an obvious target for additional taxation in times of need. Both the Alamanni and Tervingi tribes are known to have levied taxes on agricultural production to pay for the support of their armies.	true
technologies_long_description_bel_roman_civil_imperial_logothetes	'Logothetes' were the accountants, administrators, and scribes of the late period, Eastern Roman Empire. From Greek, the word literally translates as 'one who sets the word'. The position was noted as far back as at least the time of Septimius Severus, before the Empire was split in two. By the time of Justinian, however, Imperial bureaucrats were much more powerful, holding jurisdiction over revenue-gathering and even dispatched to oversee that military expeditions remained on or close to their agreed budget. Logothetes were paid an allowance of twelve percent of each piece of revenue they gathered in the Empire's name - something that ensured many of them became extremely wealthy.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_logistics	An army can live off the land in most places. What can’t be found, stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried. This meant arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load, medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable, as opposed to just plain miserable. Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or exhausted. He will not give his best in such circumstances, no matter how inspiring the leadership qualities of his commanders.	true

technologies_long_description_att_slav_civil_advanced_agriculture_venedi	The Slavs, as a mobile, 'barbarian' culture, were particularly capable farmers - far better, as the Roman Emperor Maurice stated, than "savage warriors". Indeed, he said that they had "an abundance of all kinds of animals and agricultural produce". Archaeological evidence shows a development of Slavic agricultural technology throughout late antiquity. This led to a surplus of supplies that allowed them to thrive and grow. The transient, on-the-move nature of the Slavic tribes also benefited their endeavours - in new areas, they would burn down forests to make room for fields. The ash created was then used as a potent fertiliser. The Slavs would also settle, whenever possible, along valley beds where the soil was fertile and water abundant. Once they had tilled the soil until it was unworkable they would then move somewhere else, allowing the forests to reclaim the used land. However, over time, the Slavs developed a system of crop rotation, allowing some of the fields to lie fallow (ploughed, but not sowed) to restore their fertility.

Tools of bronze (then iron) enabled the land to be cultivated, ships to be built, stone to be quarried, and wars to be fought with increasing brutality and a terrible savagery. As antiquity subsided into the Middle Ages, blacksmiths remained ubiquitous: every village and town of note had a smithy turning out anything the community needed. Smithing also encouraged trade, as the iron needed to create steel was not always a local resource. Iron gave warriors an edge in combat, often quite literally; it allowed weapons and armour of greater strength to be forged.	true

The most dramatic changes occurred under Theoderic the Great, who from AD475 oversaw the construction of some of the greatest monuments of the era, including a palace and mausoleum - which was constructed to his exact specifications. He also oversaw the construction of a palatial personal chapel, the Basilica of Saint'Apollinare Nuovo, which he adorned with incredibly intricate mosaics and religious relics along the walls. 	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_slavic_martial_culture_sclaveni	Battle was an integral part of the various barbarian cultures of antiquity. Tribes of all ethnicities fought the neighbouring Celts, Germans, Slavs, Norsemen, Greeks, nomads and, above all others, the expansionist, imperialist Romans. Amongst themselves, tribes fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class or two nominated champions facing off in single combat. For the would-be warrior, displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids once they had reached manhood. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true

Starting with Abu Bakr, the four decreed who was to be their successor, yet the process of succession soon broke down as those desirous for power plotted against each other to seize control. The first non-Rashidan caliph was Muawiyah I, the first of the Umayyads, and under him the Islamic empire quickly spread as far west as Al-Andalus. The Umayyads' legacy saw a surge in converts to Islam, yet they were criticised for the transformation of the caliphate from having an elected leader to a having 'divinely sanctioned', hereditary monarchy.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_civil_patrimonial_monarch	The notion of hereditary monarchy, whereby the crown is passed down to the eldest male heir of a royal family, was a concept quite alien to the new kingdoms of Europe. Their barbarian culture was rooted in leading through strength, and dynastic disputes arose when stronger candidates initiated struggles for the crown. In Ostrogothic Italy, Theoderic left his son-in-law, Eutharic, as his heir. However, Eutharic's death left Theoderic's baby grandson as king, requiring a regent to rule in his stead until he came of age. Though his mother Amalasuntha became regent, the political situation had already become untenable and Theoderic's hard-fought legacy was undone by a violent power struggle. In Vandalic Africa, hereditary monarchy was more successful, as all the kingdom's rulers were of the same family and the crown passed successfully between them as each successive king died. It was the Vandalic kingdom's policies, rather than external bids for power, that caused its ultimate collapse.	true

The advent of defined currencies in gold, silver, bronze and electrum improved matters somewhat, as it was no longer as easy to argue about what something was worth, and therefore how much tax should be paid to the crown. The development of coinage was also symptomatic of the vast amounts of frankincense, myrrh, copper, ivory, glassware, and slaves being traded, so organised tax calculation and collection systems were necessary just to keep officials aware of (most of) what was going on.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_land_grants	In order to cement and legitimise their rule, the former 'barbarian' kingdoms sought to go further than merely adding a layer of their most prestigious people on top of the old Roman societal infrastructure. Alliances were forged and loyalty secured through intermarriage between ruling houses, a practice which continued right up to the modern age. Another way of maintaining stability was to 'buy' allegiances via the gifting of strategically-positioned territories, thus ensuring that potential rivals were placated and, rather more cynically, so 'buffer' states existed between the giver and any hostile powers. Initially all this was designed in order to present a united front against the Byzantine Romans – who would surely come to reclaim their former Empire in the west – but eventually was just a way of keeping the emergent royal houses in control of their kingdoms.	true
technologies_long_description_bel_roman_civil_state_monopolies	The Eastern Roman Empire, at its peak, covered roughly 1.3 million square kilometres. The diversity of climates spanning the vast Imperial holdings ranged from Mediterranean warmth to frigid Balkan forestry, and with this came a wide variety of agricultural output. Wheat was the primary crop, being grown across the majority of the Empire, but also barley, rye and oats - especially in more northern, arid locales. Luxury items, such as olives and wine, were the key financial crops and brought in the most money. The discovery of numerous, tiny pockets of soil in the Syrian massif regions is indicative of a specialised industry there, dedicated to the cultivation and production of olives, much like the specialist vineyards scattered across the Empire. The diversity of the crops grown was used both internally and externally, sustaining both Rome and her people as well as being transported, when possible, to trading partners. As well as Empire-wide and international distribution, evidence suggests that the Near East was also a hub for prosperous local trade; the discovery of coins and pottery across the area attest to this, as does the economic survival of the region far beyond that of more distant Imperial acquisitions, such as Britannia.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_unified_law	The role of law and the legal profession gained increasing traction as the Roman Empire developed, establishing a position of importance next to rhetoric in late antiquity. As Imperial bureaucracy intensified, the profession of law became integral in cutting through the obfuscation before the publication of tomes like the Codex Theodosianus. The Codex itself represented a monumental improvement in Imperial legal science, as it stimulated a proliferation of legal minds under Imperial administration. At first, legal study was folded into aspects of general Roman bureaucracy, with little need for formal training. However, eventually, legal tuition was available in Rome, Ravenna and Constantinople, alongside the school of law that had existed in Berytus for quite some time. Formal legal training gained more importance as late antiquity progressed, and as the roles within the Empire became more specialised. The pretentious and morally pontificating language of the Codex Theodosianus is an example of the kind of training the scholars received, both in law and in rhetoric, painting an image of Imperial majesty and, fittingly, obscurity.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_roman_style_billeting_laws	Billeting is the practice of housing troops in privately-owned property. For the Roman army this type of accommodation was known as ‘hospitalitas’, from which we get ‘hospitality’. The troops were given one third of their billet's living space and their rations were provided by the provincial authorities, not their hosts. Troops would know which house they were assigned to because their names would be carved on its door post. Billeting troops became a common occurrence in the 4th and 5th century AD as the Western Romans needed to ensure its troops could quickly reach problem areas in their rapidly deteriorating Empire. The limitanei, or frontier units, were well used to maintaining and defending positions over long periods. Compared to the comitatenses, they were static and entrenched within local populaces. Limitanei were even assigned lands in some provinces and conducted maintenance when they weren't fighting. As such, limes became desirable residences, highlighting how easy it was to exploit troop privileges. The mobile field armies of comitatenses were less static and so were often billeted in cities when on campaign. This, again, provided ample opportunity for exploitation and corruption; the most desirable properties and fertile lands were conveniently appropriated by the army to meet the comitatenses’ needs.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_military_hunnic_storm	The term ‘Hunnic storm’ has been used to describe the mass migration caused by the movement of the Huns. Word of this terrifying menace reached the Roman borders in AD376, when officers on the Danube received reports of a great disturbance on the other side of the river. These reports were swiftly followed by the arrival of large numbers of Goths fleeing for their lives and begging for sanctuary within an empire they had hitherto considered their enemy. Fear of the Huns drove many once-powerful tribes and confederations into Roman territory, some were settled peacefully while others forcefully took what they needed for their people, unwilling to play Rome's game when their very survival was at stake.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_multicultural_tolerance	For the nomadic and barbarian tribes, migration was an integral part of their lives. When summer passed into autumn and winter, so too would the tribes move to a warmer climate where they could continue to live and thrive. Then, when the spring returned, they would move on once again. Late antiquity, however, brought with it plummeting global temperatures combined with population levels reaching all-time highs, so migration became a more desperate and permanent affair. Before the shifting weather forced their flight, however, tribal warbands advocated transhumanism, ostensibly so that livestock would always have fresh grazing, but also so the nomads themselves could find new lands and cultures to raid and pillage. The Huns, in particular, made a move towards the Danube, not for reasons of residence, but to be nearer to the spectacular wealth of the Roman Empire.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_distribution_of_wealth	As many former ‘barbarian’ peoples had been brought under Rome’s yolk during the Republican and early Imperial years, Germanic soldiers had served directly in the Roman army for several centuries. Over time, many rose to be Senators and high-ranking administrators such as Magister Militum – a position which was held by several men of barbarian descent over the years. By the 4th and 5th centuries AD, the only way of distinguishing between these ‘Romanitas’ and those of ‘true blood’ was their names, indicating that they had become fully integrated into Roman society in almost every way. The net result of this was the ‘Romanisation’ of many Germanic leaders, which in turn led to a great degree of Romanisation of the barbarian kingdoms that succeeded the collapsed Western Empire from AD476. In order to cement and legitimise their rule, the barbarian successor kings sought to go further than merely adding a layer of their most prestigious people on top of existing Roman society. The Ostrogothic king, Theoderic the Great, for instance, immediately forged alliances through the marriage of his most loyal free men to the daughters of Roman nobles and those of his barbarian rivals amongst the Vandals, etc. in order that society might quickly return to a sense of normality and community, and life might go on relatively unhindered. There was an ulterior motive, however, in that Theoderic wished barbarian Europe to stand behind him against the Eastern Roman Empire and any attempts to recapture the territory lost following the West's collapse. Unfortunately, his marriage-alliance policy was only partially successful; the Visigoths were soon at war with the Franks and Theoderic's alliance with the Vandals floundered after the death of Thrasamund, a fellow Arian Christian and enemy of Constantinople.	true
technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_multicultural_practices	The reason for Attila's conquest of Europe, and the avalanche of displacement he began, is theorised to have occurred for many possible reasons; climate change, transhumanism or the desire for conquest, yet his ambition cannot be seen as wholly culturally motivated. In fact, Attila embraced an even greater cultural tolerance than eastern nations like the Sassanids, who were accepting of all so long as their laws were obeyed. His aspirations were motivated by a desire for power, for riches and for living space for the Hunnic people. Therefore, those tribes that were amalgamated into his growing empire were welcomed, providing they did all that Attila asked of them. This tolerance of other cultures, combined with Attila's far-ranging conquests, meant cultural osmosis was inevitable as the Huns impacted on their clients and vice versa. For instance, from excavation it is impossible to tell the difference between tools fashioned by the Germanic and Hunnic cultures of the period. Further, the Huns came to learn the Germanic language out of necessity, as well as dress like their barbarian subjects, but that may have been due to the cold weather gripping Europe at the time. It indicates that the Hunnic empire became a fusion of the various steppe nomads and barbarian cultures it encompassed. The way to prosperity was clearly tied to the appropriation of Hunnic culture, and to make oneself as Hun-like as possible. The identity of a man, therefore, became a premium commodity; as the Germanic tribes that were the bulk of Attila's European army became Hunnic, the Huns in turn, became more European.	true

This system persisted throughout the ancient period, as shown by grave goods found in later tombs. Weapons are always found in abundance, with many modern historians postulating that elaborate arms and armour discovered inside the graves of the wealthy may have had a purely ceremonial purpose.	true

Around this time, single-edged weapons from the east also appeared - such as the longsword and the seax - examples of which have been discovered inside the tombs of high-ranking barbarians in Altlussheim, Tournai and Pouan.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_roman_system_of_logistics	An army can live off the land in most places. What can’t be found, stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried with it: arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load, medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable as opposed to just plain miserable. Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or exhausted.

The construction of more complex canals and dams helped to turn arid landscapes into well-irrigated farming plots.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_frank_civil_carolingian_architecture	Under the Merovingian dynasty, the Franks pioneered what is now known as the Pre-Romanesque style of architecture and art, which attempted to collate Christian and Mediterranean styles of architecture into a new type of design. Most of the architectural efforts of the Pre-Romanesque period are exemplified by churches and basilicas, whose numbers increased dramatically during the Merovingian period. The monastery at Lorsch, Germany, is a good example of this style, with a stout, steep-roofed gatehouse and arched facade and columns. The gatehouse's triple-arched entrance is an evolution of Pre-Romanesque styles adopted by the later Carolingians as they added Roman features to the existing architectural model. This is also evidenced by the original Palatine Chapel at Charlemagne's Palace of Aachen. Although the original chapel no longer exists, it was reconstructed according to original designs, with an octagonal dome at the centre, over the cloister-vault. Charlemagne's body was interred at the chapel, but unfortunately his body was moved more than once during Medieval times and its location is no longer known.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_military_improved_siege_engines	The established norms of siege warfare changed during the Middle Ages. The same general principles of starvation and destruction applied, but as cities became larger and more fortified, the method of cracking these increasingly daunting defences also had to adapt. The onager and ballista were still common sights in a siege engineer's arsenal, but so too were newer, more adventurous weapons like the trebuchet and mangonel. Enormous, beam-sling weapons that hurled rocks (or whatever the general chose - even enemy prisoners!) in gigantic arcs before releasing them, created enormous amounts of force with which the attacker hoped to smash down walls or fire over them to destroy the city beyond. However, not always were these weapons the key to victory - at the Siege of Pavia in AD773-4, Charlemagne failed to bring siege equipment to his assault on the Lombard capital, and so the Frankish king was forced to starve the city out. This, combined with a Lombard failure to adequately prepare for the siege, resulted in their capitulation in June of AD774 - such tried and tested methods of old rarely fail, it seems.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_civil_trade_hubs	Whilst those parts of Europe inside the boundaries of the Roman Empire prospered during antiquity, due to the great roads and merchant fleets built to facilitate commerce, northern, Germanic Europe generally languished in relative isolation. This was only made worse by the movement of the Roman capital further east to Constantinople in the 4th century AD, and the great climate change that ravaged the crops and natural wealth of much of northern and eastern Europe during the Migration Period. By the 7th century AD, however, the Merovingian Frankish kings began revitalising trade in northern Europe with a fair at St. Denis, which connected cities across the northern continent, mainly via old Roman roads and the network of rivers that lattice Europe. As the climate change abated, ports and river villages began to become important trade hubs once again, and none more so than the city of Dorestad. Ideally positioned between the Franks and the Frisians, it allowed merchants a convenient half-way point to meet and do business. Its value, however, dragged it into a battle for power between the two, a conflict that widened as the Middle Ages progressed, ultimately leading to the downfall of Dorestad as a major trading city.	true

Aside from what was needed to survive, within Attila's Hunnic empire the most important thing was the continued flow of treasure and riches to its leadership.

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_military_defence_depth	Decisive, pitched battles are not always the best option, especially if you are the outnumbered defender. As borders expanded faster than armies could grow, the idea of "preclusive defence" (a line of border forts and outposts to intercept incursions) became more difficult to maintain. "Defence in depth" was a new concept which allowed the enemy to conquer some ground, but spread them out thinly so they could be dealt with more easily. The defenders then closed around and harassed the weaker portions of the invading army, pushing them back to beyond the borders if not destroying them outright. This defensive strategy was further developed during the Middle Ages with the construction of hill forts and concentric castles, which drew the enemy invaders into layers of defences. Methods such as these exacted a heavy toll on attacking forces, as they repeatedly had to run a gauntlet of missile fire whilst scaling the walls.	true

Conversely, Sassanid Persia had a much more hierarchical structure to its governance.

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_military_war_elephant_husbandry	War elephants were not battle-winning weapons on their own. They had to be used properly and given the right support if they were to break an enemy line and, with it, the will to fight on. Often, elephants were accompanied into battle by a screen of friendly skirmishers, whose job it was to keep them from being harassed by the enemy’s own light troops before charging. The sheer size of an elephant was enough to instil terror even before it hurled men away, impaled them on its tusks, or trampled them to death. Even in the best battle conditions elephants could be unpredictable: they often reacted angrily if their handlers were killed or wounded, but could also turn on those same men when the stress of battle pushed them to breaking point. However, sent forward at the right moment, war elephants could sweep away all before them. Indian elephants first came to the Middle East when Seleucus, one of Alexander the Great’s Successors, invaded India in 305BC. The inheritors of much of their eastern empire, the Parthians and Sassanid Persians, continued to breed and field war elephants long after the Seleucids had fallen by the wayside.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_sacred_king	The idea of divine authority bestowed upon a leader was not a new or even an uncommon idea in the Middle Ages. This is unsurprising when one considers that many Roman Emperors, particularly before the Empire's adoption of Christianity, believed themselves to be chosen by the gods to rule. Kingship itself was often equated with the role of a judge or high priest, with the leader of a nation often also being its religious head, or at least a powerful representation of state religion for his subject people. Monarchies were generally thought "above earthly authority" and chosen to rule by the divine, and to do so on its behalf.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_military_warrior_kings	Power in the desert kingdoms, much like in the barbarian tribes to the far north, was determined by military strength - leaders guided their people to glory and power through victory in battle. Men like Ezana and Kaleb of Aksum campaigned along the Nile Valley and into the Arabian Peninsula, subjugating any in their way. Power, however, was often more attractive than loyalty; as was the case with Abraha, an Aksumite viceroy who declared himself King of Himyar upon his arrival in Arabia. Yet it was not just kings who became prominent warriors. Two of the most famous warrior kings were, in fact, warrior queens. Zenobia of Palmyra, and later Queen Mavia of the Tanukhids, led their people in daring, stunning revolts against the Roman Empire. Mavia herself rode at the head of her Arabic army and ultimately forced Rome into capitulating to her demands. Such was her strength, that the Roman Emperor later requested Tanukhid assistance in fighting Imperial enemies on the other side of the Empire.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_communal_maintenance	As late antiquity eclipsed the Western Roman Empire, and it faded from existence, the invading barbarian tribes from the north found themselves heirs to the remnants of Roman establishment. Although fragmentary and no longer ruled as a unified state, the tribes now inhabiting Italy adopted many of the former Empire's structures and societies, and the nobles of its Senate, in governance. Theoderic the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, saw that many administrative offices were filled by his own men, including the philosopher Boethius as his Magister Officiorum. In this manner, the king slowly wore away the claims to power of rival families so appeasing him became their chief concern. This ensured that his title remained safeguarded from cloying, usurping hands.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_muslim_military_defence_depth	Decisive, pitched battles are not always the best option, especially if you are the outnumbered defender. As borders expanded faster than armies could grow, the idea of "preclusive defence" (a line of border forts and outposts to intercept incursions) became more difficult to maintain. "Defence in depth" was a new concept which allowed the enemy to conquer some ground, but spread them out thinly so they could be dealt with more easily. The defenders then closed around and harassed the weaker portions of the invading army, pushing them back to beyond the borders if not destroying them outright. This defensive strategy was further developed during the Middle Ages with the construction of hill forts and concentric castles, which drew the enemy invaders into layers of defences. Methods such as these exacted a heavy toll on attacking forces, as they repeatedly had to run a gauntlet of missile fire whilst scaling the walls.	true
technologies_long_description_bel_roman_military_eastern_heavy_cavalry_tactics	As the Roman Empire divided and struggled into late antiquity, one of the chief problems its army had to address was cavalry, which was greatly inferior compared to that of its enemies. The Hunnic and barbarian hordes that swept down from the steppes did so on horseback, and to the east the Sassanid Persian armies smashed their foes apart with their decisive heavy cataphracts. Rome was slow to adapt to the changing face of mounted warfare, as their chief allies primarily fielded foot soldiers. After initially resisting the need for change, the Empire finally started to develop new cavalry types that could effectively challenge eastern cataphracts and nomadic lancers. The Eastern Romans, particularly, developed the clibinarii based on the eastern cataphracts, as a response to the threat posed by the unstoppable Sassanid charge. Clibanarii and catafractarii wore head to foot mail or scale armour and carried long 'kontos' lances to unseat mounted opponents and smash through infantry lines.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_civil_exemption_from_military_service	Over time, the Sassanids reformed many institutions so that more of the empire could be controlled by a central authority. In the beginning, however, the monarchy operated similarly to its Parthian predecessors, with satraps being almost independent kingdoms that fed support back into the state. Ardashir I began building new 'royal' cities and renaming old ones, creating territories that were loyal to the Shahanshah and not to over-powerful nobles. He was able to place his own men and labour forces in these cities, creating a loyal populace. Although they were still semi-independent, royal cities were nevertheless unified by state administration, and not reliant on the whims of noble and minor kings. There is evidence that the newly settled people were apportioned a division of land, as evidenced by a Sassanid deputy, vested with authority over Dura, owning an estate just outside the city. Despite this increase in central state control, the Shahanshah continued  to promote the policy of religious tolerance instituted by the Parthians whilst championing Zoroastrianism as the official state religion at the same time. This religious tolerance was borne out in the royal cities, where the majority of the artisan class (masons, woodworkers, stone cutters, etc.) were Christian. These artisans, unless in a royal workshop, belonged to private 'corporations', which worked much like early guilds or unions. Artisans, particularly Christian ones, were able obtain exemption from military service as a perk of their craft. This was not a boon granted to the peasantry, who were levied wholesale to fight in the Shahanshah's wars.	true

technologies_long_description_att_roman_west_civil_decentralised_state	Traditionally, the empires and nations of antiquity ruled from a central hub of power; a ruling class or royal family, in charge of everything below them. All aspects of the Roman Republic and, later, the Empire were controlled centrally, from the city of Rome itself. However, a decentralisation of power occurred as late antiquity progressed. As a result, the Roman Empire became increasingly bureaucratic and non-linear - the phrase "Byzantine bureaucracy" refers to the almost maddening  amount of red tape generated. Over the centuries, due to the Empire's vast size, provinces were gradually given greater and greater levels of autonomy, transferring much of the decision-process to local government. A similar system was used in the Vandal Kingdom, where Gelimer allowed loyal retainers to control individual regions, something that was to be his eventual undoing; their eventual rebellion against his oppression of Nicene Christians attracted the machinations of Emperor Justinian.	true
technologies_long_description_att_roman_west_civil_legal_science	The role of law and the legal profession gained increasing traction as the Roman Empire developed, establishing a position of importance next to rhetoric in late antiquity. As Imperial bureaucracy intensified, the profession of law became integral in cutting through the obfuscation before the publication of tomes like the Codex Theodosianus. The Codex itself represented a monumental improvement in Imperial legal science, as it stimulated a proliferation of legal minds under Imperial administration. At first, legal study was folded into aspects of general Roman bureaucracy, with little need for formal training. However, eventually, legal tuition was available in Rome, Ravenna and Constantinople, alongside the school of law that had existed in Berytus for quite some time. Formal legal training gained more importance as late antiquity progressed, and as the roles within the Empire became more specialised. The pretentious and morally pontificating language of the Codex Theodosianus is an example of the kind of training the scholars received, both in law and in rhetoric, painting an image of Imperial majesty and, fittingly, obscurity.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_military_unified_state_military_langobardi	Many barbarian peoples of the Migration Period were originally confederacies, each with their own leader. This often led to infighting and, in the case of the Visigoths, civil war. It wasn’t until Euric became king that he was able to defeat many of the powerful chieftains and unite them under one leader. With this new found power, Euric expanded the bounds of his territory into Hispania; by the time of the Western Roman Empire's collapse he had taken control of most of the Iberian Peninsula, all except Galatia. On his death the Visigoths also controlled around a third of Gaul, although they eventually lost all their holdings in the south of the country due to the relentless expansion of the neighbouring Frankish Empire.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_military_combined_force_tactics	Before the reforms of Khosrow I, equipment was generally provided by the soldiers themselves. As the Sassanid standing army was drawn mainly from the upper aristocracy, money was no object and equipping horse and rider was simple. With Khosrow's military shakeup, however, things changed. With the newly emerged lower nobility, the Dekhan, now able to enlist, their equipment and training was provided by the central government. The Shahanshah enforced 'equipment lists' when mustering to ensure all soldiers were correctly geared. Armaments were also made and stored during peacetime in arsenals, ready for immediate distribution when hostilities commenced. In this way, an army was created that was capable of deploying faster and fighting longer on multiple fronts. When the Shahanshah did call his satraps to war, men would rally from all corners of the empire, each bringing their regional individualities. Over time, a level of regimentation emerged, with a standardisation emerging of heavy armour for nobility, but with caveats for archery. The numerous light horse archers, in the Parthian style, became more organised with standardised armour and bows. The individual style of regional forces remained, but the organisation of the Sassanid war machine greatly improved.	true

The agricultural surplus of the conquered, for instance, was particularly abused; stolen by the Huns as part of a larger trend of organised livestock rustling.

technologies_long_description_att_roman_civil_new_roman_ethics	Emperor Constantine the Great, the man who officially brought Christianity to the Roman Empire, stated that his victories were a result of his faith in the “God of the Christians”. This was not merely an proclamation of faith, it was an intelligent assessment of the spirit of the age; by saying this he was recognising that the support of the Church was essential to his goal of uniting the many disparate groups within Imperial boundaries under a single banner. By the same token, Imperial recognition meant an end to persecution for Christians in many corners of the Empire, and their unequivocal support for the Emperor’s agenda. All this may sound like politically expedient propaganda – and it was – but Constantine also believed that God had chosen him to bring the Christian faith and good Imperial order to the wider world beyond the frontier: one faith, and a single Roman ethic, united. 	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_armed_citizenry	There is no denying that the Carolingian Franks, and even the Merovingian kings before them, created a militarised society in an attempt to forge a European power equal to the might of once-great Rome. Every aspect of feudal society was made combat ready, from the elite aristocracy with heavy horse and armour - proto-knights - to the land-working peasants, drafted by regional magnates into fighting for their king and their homes. Those not called to be part of a standing army remained in their villages and were expected to be able to fight in their defence. Regional lords and magnates established their own defences; watchtowers and fortifications built atop the old bastions of Rome. One such fortification was at Carcassonne - an old Roman redoubt that the Bellonid dynasty, rulers of the province, further fortified during the Carolingian age. Whilst some of those charged with defending the city beyond would have been privately funded, armed peasantry from the surrounding area would doubtless have been made to do their part.	true
technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_military_horse_husbandry	The nomads of the steppes relied on their horses for all aspects of their lives, not only for war. It is therefore not surprising that they were able to develop the fastest cavalry the Romans had ever seen. Smaller than their western counter parts and far sturdier, the Turkish ponies favoured by the steppe peoples were also much better at climbing, swimming, and jumping. They could survive harsh climates and live on grass alone, meaning that when the Huns expanded their empire they didn’t have to limit their attacks to places where sufficient fodder could be found. This ease of care also meant steppe warriors were able to maintain several horses when migrating or on campaign, making it possible for them cover greater distances without needing to rest their mounts.	true

Investigation into more natural solutions revealed preliminary understanding of atomics, which fed into understanding of the elements. As the Romans conquered their philosophy expanded to become self-aggrandising; Rome conquered, thus Rome was right. Great edifices to their glory, and to the gods, were erected from concrete in impressively short timeframes. Christianity, and the notion of the Emperor's semi-divinity, later bolstered the self-absorbed notion of Roman philosophy and its outlook on the world -  the Emperor was charged with the task of uniting the world, in the name of God! This notion persisted among the barbarian kingdoms which followed the Empire, into the Middle Ages and beyond - the monarch was chosen by God himself to rule on His behalf. 	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_animal_fertilisation_techniques	Ancient barbarian society was built on agriculture, so naturally many of its laws dealt with this important aspect of life. Clearly identifying the boundaries between farmland was paramount, so boundary pillar stones were erected to demarcate the edges of people's property. The idea was that their presence would cut down the amount of land disputes that occurred, as moving the pillars to a more favourable position was very much a Herculean task. In Ireland, Cormac mac Cuileannanin’s ‘Sanas Chormaic’ called them ‘gallan,’ as they were first erected by the Gauls when they arrived there. This type of stone has also been found in England and Scotland, often with names engraved on them in ‘Ogham' script.	true

Charlemagne formalised this work, making it central a central tenet of their duty to their congregations.

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_campaign_planning	During late antiquity, there was little attempt by the European powers to stratify and organise their forces in the same way as the Roman army. In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

On the other hand, attackers knew that starving out the defenders may take time but would likely result in ultimate victory. However, it was only after increased contact with the enemy that they truly learned. Roman siege techniques, and the technology that went with them, took hold elsewhere as the art of urban warfare developed.

Equus ferus’ role was tied to its physical form – the small, early horse could only be used to pull primitive chariots. Larger, faster horses were later bred and used by skirmishers to chase down troops, but it was not until the development of more muscular breeds that shock troops such as the cataphracts came into being. Their long lances and heavy armour made these new-style heavy cavalry units deadly against infantry, fundamentally changing the nature of warfare forever. The racing of horses for sport went hand in hand with their military use, and of course provided useful training for both rider and animal.	true

Both peoples spoke and wrote in a Semitic language, Sabaic. Although its origins are not known, it may have developed from the Byblos alphabet, an ancient and as-yet undeciphered proto-hieroglyphic script discovered in Lebanon. The surviving examples of Sabaic script are found on stone tablets in a style called 'boustrophedon', where each line is written in the opposite direction to the last - like turning an ox when ploughing a field and reaching the end of a furrow. Sabaic, although distinct, does bear many similarities to the other Arabian Semitic languages. Like many of them, it has no vowels (abjad) - the speaker automatically making the vowels by saying the word aloud. The language has several regional variations, but we know most about Middle Sabaic, dating from between the 3rd century BC and the 3rd century AD.	true

There is evidence that the newly settled people were apportioned a division of land, as evidenced by a Sassanid deputy, vested with authority over Dura, owning an estate just outside the city. Despite this increase in central state control, the Shahanshah continued  to promote the policy of religious tolerance instituted by the Parthians whilst championing Zoroastrianism as the official state religion at the same time. This religious tolerance was borne out in the royal cities, where the majority of the artisan class (masons, woodworkers, stone cutters, etc.) were Christian. These artisans, unless in a royal workshop, belonged to private 'corporations', which worked much like early guilds or unions. Artisans, particularly Christian ones, were able obtain exemption from military service as a perk of their craft. This was not a boon granted to the peasantry, who were levied wholesale to fight in the Shahanshah's wars.	true
technologies_long_description_att_eastern_military_cavalry_recruitment_reforms	The aristocracy provided the bulk of the Sassanid Savaran, or cavalry forces. Initially this was restricted to the upper echelons of Azadan nobility, so the standing army of Sassanid cavalry remained limited. The reforms of Khosrow changed that, however. Firstly the Dehkans - lesser nobility - were allowed into the Savaran, which greatly swelled the ranks of the elite cavalry as well as the domestic forces of light horse. They were also paid a regular wage and treated as a real standing army. Khosrow also increased the recruitment of mercenary forces to swell armies in time of need.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_military_defence_depth	Decisive, pitched battles are not always the best option, especially if you are the outnumbered defender. As borders expanded faster than armies could grow, the idea of "preclusive defence" (a line of border forts and outposts to intercept incursions) became more difficult to maintain. "Defence in depth" was a new concept which allowed the enemy to conquer some ground, but spread them out thinly so they could be dealt with more easily. The defenders then closed around and harassed the weaker portions of the invading army, pushing them back to beyond the borders if not destroying them outright. This defensive strategy was further developed during the Middle Ages with the construction of hill forts and concentric castles, which drew the enemy invaders into layers of defences. Methods such as these exacted a heavy toll on attacking forces, as they repeatedly had to run a gauntlet of missile fire whilst scaling the walls.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_roman_civil_revived_roman_law	One of Justinian's enduring legacies was his comprehensive codification all of Roman law into one body of work. In order to do this he set up a commission to review the statutes and discard anything that was out of date or unnecessary. After fourteen months the compilation, known as 'Corpus Juris Civilis',  was complete, although some conflicting entries remained pending definitive rulings by the Emperor. The 'Codex Justinianus' - as it came to be known - was employed in the Pragmatic Sanction of AD554, when Justinian redefined Italy's internal power structures following Belisarius' reconquest. This Church-led sanction returned land to the Roman aristocracy, along with the slaves liberated by the Ostrogoths, and brought the region back under the jurisdiction of the Roman taxation and legal systems. A highly-influential body of work, many of the provisions set out in the Codex Justinianus went on to be used in the wider western world for centuries to come.	true

These people, though contentious, were respected for their fighting zeal and passion. Therefore, once settled in strategic locations around the empire, a more belligerent attitude would be engendered amongst the ranks and communities they occupied, fostering a greater military culture. In addition, the resettled people could be placed wherever the Shahanshah desired, meaning they would be loyal to him without being reliant on nobles for support, which helped form a core of imperial troops.	true

This is unsurprising when one considers that many Roman Emperors, particularly before the Empire's adoption of Christianity, believed themselves to be chosen by the gods to rule. Kingship itself was often equated with the role of a judge or high priest, with the leader of a nation often also being its religious head, or at least a powerful representation of state religion for his subject people. Monarchies were generally thought "above earthly authority" and chosen to rule by the divine, and to do so on its behalf.	true

However, and the horse was a prized commodity on the battlefield, and did not appear in abundance. The aristocratic classes of warrior still rode, as they could afford the expensive animal and the necessary equipment, but most members of Frankish armies were not nobles. Shock cavalry was perhaps even more of a rarity, with whatever cavalry divisions were available mainly used as raiding and ambushing forces. There is also some debate over how many of the 35,000 cavalry attested to in the records of bannum and latweri summons were genuine cavalry specialists, as opposed to 'mounted infantry'. Mounted infantry units could move quickly across the battlefield, but more importantly TO the battlefield - Charlemagne's speedy conquest of Europe was due in part to his use of horses to shuttle infantry to the front lines, where they would dismount and fight on foot.	true

It is also relatively simple to extract gold from rock as it is pure and easily distinguishable. Initially Rome and Greece had only small deposits but through their conquests gained access to greater supplies. Slaves would toil over six hundred feet below ground in mines that were exploited until they collapsed. The Greeks prized gold so highly that they attempted to turn base metals into gold, an ‘art’ known as alchemy. By the early Middle Ages gold had replaced silver as the most desirable, and therefore most expensive, substance in the world.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_military_militarised_massing_of_power	The Huns staged their attacks on the Western Romans from the Middle Danubian Plain, amassing and concentrating all their manpower there. Their choice of entry point into the Empire had knock-on effects that may have been responsible for its downfall. When faced with the vast Hunnic onslaught before them other militarised tribes chose to leave the Danubian Plain rather than stand and fight. Although some sought shelter peacefully others attacked the Romans standing in their way, weakening their forces even before the Huns had invaded Roman territory proper. For every tribe that fled the Huns' advance there were others that aligned with them, seeking a share of Rome's spoils and significantly bolstering the horde's numbers.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_planned_movement	During late antiquity, there was little attempt by the European powers to stratify and organise their forces in the same way as the Roman army. In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

Later, the Goths and Vandals were also known for wearing 'lamella', an early form of plate armour constructed of overlapping plates laced into horizontal rows.

technologies_long_description_cha_frank_military_freemen_training	The freemen of Charlemagne's kingdom were called to war in two ways. One was the 'lantweri', a general call to arms that was critical; failure to meet this summons could result in the death penalty. The second was as part of the king’s 'bannum' and, whilst not as important as the lantweri, still carried a heavy fine for non-compliance. Responsibility for training and equipping the summoned freemen fell to local leaders, called 'leudes', who also decided who should remain behind to work the land so there was something to come back to. Most men knew the basics of combat, as hunting was a daily occurrence, but not all training was of the same standard. Basic  training involved practice against a straw dummy, as well as splitting into groups and sparring with one another. Whilst rudimentary, the hope was it might make them useful or, at least, live longer on the battlefield.	true

According to Roman writers like Ammianus Marcellinus, they were barely-human barbarians who knew no gods and followed no laws. However, there was one area of Hunnic life that Roman writers praised: their skill in battle. Hunnic cavalry was fast and deadly, able to loose volleys of arrows from incredible distances before riding down those unfortunate enough to survive. The mounts they used were bred for life in the harsh environment of the steppes and were often inter-bred with wild horses, resulting in a certain natural vigour that Roman cavalry lacked.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_christ_civil_feudalism	With the collapse the Empire, Europe of the Middle Ages evolved the Roman villa system into three elements; the feudal system, manorialism and serfdom. Feudalism divided the king's land into territories (or 'fiefs'), which were ruled by vassals in his name. Most of the land in Carolingian Europe was held 'allodially', meaning the  vassal was vested with total control and (importantly) defence of the land in the name of the king. Manorialism legitimised the power they had, as the manor became the centre of local legal and economic authority. The lord of the manor became the most important local figure, his subjects tasked with working the surrounding land of the estate. At the bottom of this system (often represented by a triangle with the king at the apex) were the serfs, who were made to work the land in a system only slightly removed from slavery. The serfs worked the land for their own gain, but owed their masters a share of the produce that was grown. They were dependant on the lord's land to work, and were legally bound never to leave his service.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_military_warrior_aristocracy	If the collapse of the Roman Empire made one thing clear, it was that life would never – could never – be the same as it had been for centuries prior. The barbarian kingdoms that swept away Rome's remnants assumed much of its workable infrastructure, particularly that relating to the organisation of the armed forces. Of course, this also gave them a means of controlling the young, educated class who might otherwise fight against the new regimes; by offering status – and maybe, eventually, power – via conscription into in the army, their loyalty could be secured. The kingdoms of the late Dark and early Middle Ages were still very much warrior societies at heart, and therefore membership of the warrior class was something to be aspired to. Members were obligated to fight for the king, and provide troops from their own retinues, whenever he called them to do so. In return, they were given lands and titles under the proviso they enforced the king's laws and offered protection to the peasants who worked them. In real terms, this was a license to behave in almost any way they liked - the vassals had the weapons and the training to make any point they so chose; the serfs, on the other hand, had none of those things, and therefore no chance to rise up and change their situation. 	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_civil_exchange_expertise	There is a general assertion among historians that, by AD400, the barbarians’ pottery industry had died. Yet this is oversimplifying the situation somewhat; whilst it is true that specialised industries declined across the Roman Empire and beyond, there were some places where it endured. In Britannia, for example, the pottery industry all but evaporated as the Western Empire floundered. Places like Egypt, however, continued to produce specialised craftsmanship. In Gaul and the north of the Empire, the craftsmanship of previous centuries faded, however, and a more simplified form emerged; one which produced goods more for the sake of sale than skill. With this came a greater co-operation between individuals as craftsmen worked together, not in competition, but due to the shared (and very real) sense that the world was heading into decline. In doing so, individuals, and their families and communities, were able to survive.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_barb_military_warrior_ideals	Battle was an integral part of Dark Age 'barbarian' culture. Tribes frequently fought the neighbouring Germanic, Nordic, Celtic, and nomadic peoples, and even amongst themselves. Inter-tribal battles were generally fought on a much smaller scale - attacks typically consisting of brief raids conducted by the elite of the warrior class. Neighbouring rivals raided each other’s territory almost as sport, rather than as a serious, organised attempt to expand their boundaries. On the other hand, the wild Norsemen did so because their land couldn't produce the agricultural yields needed to feed their growing population, eventually settling in places such as England and France, where the conditions were more favourable. For the would-be warrior displays of personal bravery were the only guaranteed route to glory and status. Fighting skills were learned from a very young age through hunting and then honed on raids from the age of fourteen upward. Nobles could use this opportunity to attract followers to form a warband of their own, whereas members of the free warrior class had to impress an established band to secure a place for themselves. The typical tribal fighting style eschewed the ordered, tactical combat of the civilised peoples in favour of the heroic charge, repeated by a warband until its enemy was routed from the field or their own numbers became too few – whichever happened first.	true

It is therefore not surprising that they were able to develop the fastest cavalry the Romans had ever seen. Smaller than their western counter parts and far sturdier, the Turkish ponies favoured by the steppe peoples were also much better at climbing, swimming, and jumping. They could survive harsh climates and live on grass alone, meaning that when the Huns expanded their empire they didn’t have to limit their attacks to places where sufficient fodder could be found. This ease of care also meant steppe warriors were able to maintain several horses when migrating or on campaign, making it possible for them cover greater distances without needing to rest their mounts.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_roman_military_military_standardisation	The Roman military changed many of its organisational and logistical systems during late antiquity. For the first time since the early Republic, an annual conscription was placed on the populace, as well as a doubling of the number of armies (though with dramatically less men in each one). The increased drafting of tribal warriors into the military also meant a better template for Imperial military operations was required. During the late period of the Roman Empire, and therefore among the barbarian kingdoms that followed it, a standardisation of equipment and weaponry took place by using factories to mass-produce the required items. Inevitably, this meant a gradual reduction in quality of the items produced - something which reduced the army's effectiveness, along with less-rigorous training and drill.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_siege_techniques	The established norms of siege warfare changed during the Middle Ages. The same general principles of starvation and destruction applied, but as cities became larger and more fortified, the method of cracking these increasingly daunting defences also had to adapt. The onager and ballista were still common sights in a siege engineer's arsenal, but so too were newer, more adventurous weapons like the trebuchet and mangonel. Enormous, beam-sling weapons that hurled rocks (or whatever the general chose - even enemy prisoners!) in gigantic arcs before releasing them, created enormous amounts of force with which the attacker hoped to smash down walls or fire over them to destroy the city beyond. However, not always were these weapons the key to victory - at the Siege of Pavia in AD773-4, Charlemagne failed to bring siege equipment to his assault on the Lombard capital, and so the Frankish king was forced to starve the city out. This, combined with a Lombard failure to adequately prepare for the siege, resulted in their capitulation in June of AD774 - such tried and tested methods of old rarely fail, it seems.	true

technologies_long_description_att_hunnic_civil_monopolisation_of_support	Before the rise of Attila, who eventually became king of all the Huns, the Hunnic nation was run by several leaders, with one chief 'king' of them all. These leaders were all semi-independent yet internally ranked against one another. Over time they vanished and an authoritarian, dictatorial system emerged as Attila, at first co-ruling with his brother, Bleda, forged a Hunnic empire. Attila's rule was based primarily on intimidation of every tribe and people he encountered, maintaining power and control over them through terror. The ceaseless savagery Attila inflicted upon those who opposed him served as a warning to others, even forcing super powers such as the Eastern Romans to acquiesce to his diplomatic demands. In order to facilitate this strategy, Attila surrounded himself with various aides and chiefs from other cultures, using them as spies. He kept control of his empire by knowing his enemy's moves and keeping his subjects in check through fear, power and controlling access to information and knowledge. Attila's dictatorial control was so great that its survival was tied almost entirely to him - when he died, the fractures were almost immediate, as lesser tribes supplanted his leadership with their own local leaders, breaking his Hunnic empire apart.	true

The word zodiac comes from Greek and means "circle of animals", referring to the beasts assigned to each sign - the bull, the ram, etc. Originally, the calendar was used as an ecliptic co-ordinate system, but became associated with astrology as scholars attempted to divine how the powers of the stars affected the natural world. As such, the zodiac was used to portend dark events or to explain phenomenon like natural catastrophes or rebellions. The Himyar version of this calendar differed as it was arranged in a rectangle, with the animals ascending from left to right (so Sagittarius would be to the right of Scorpio). The animals themselves have remained the same over the years, though their significance and meaning has altered somewhat.	true

Pilgrimage was also an important part of the religious life of the region and there are stelae that describe them in minute detail, explaining how many animals should be slaughtered and what should be done in every temple along the way.

Bringing everyone in a group together around a large fire kept them warm and allowed hot meals to be shared, ensuring everyone got their fair share. This in turn engendered a sense of community, kept most predators at bay, and instilled a feeling of safety amongst the tribe members. In practice, a large fire was constructed in a circle, and everyone sat around it, talking, eating, drinking, and huddling together for warmth and companionship. Of course, communal spaces also served other important purposes. Stories were passed down from generation to generation this way; tribal histories and legends gradually melded together until they became one and the same. A gathering of the entire tribal group also gave its leaders the opportunity to reveal their plans to everyone at once, and deal with any questions or concerns they may have.	true
technologies_long_description_att_sands_tier_4_pagan_axum	The Mesopotamian pantheon is arguably the oldest religion in the world, and definitely the first to be codified. It was one of the most densely populated, with evidence of more than two thousand gods who watched over every aspect of human life. This vast religion was far-reaching in its influence; even the Arabian tribes, far to the south, worshipped Mesopotamian gods who, although slightly altered in their aspects and purposes, remained essentially the same deities. One such example is Athtar, the Semitic god of war and the morning star. He was worshipped throughout Arabia as Ishtar - also the name of the Mesopotamian goddess of fertility and war. Athtar was worshipped with flames; temples to the god contained an open pit with a fire burning in the centre. This connects Ishtar to Zoroastrianism, which has a concept of holy fire known as 'atar', illustrating just how far the influence of the old gods reaches.	true

Corruption amongst the tribal leaders was rife as a result, so centralisation was considered necessary in order to reduce it and guarantee a continuous stream of wealth into the royal coffers.

Most were raised as hunters in dense forests, so became expert at stealthy manoeuvres and laying ambush. Whilst their battle tactics were proven, their longbows, often two metres in length and made of yew, lacked the power and accuracy of composite bows made in the east. Their ammunition was also somewhat lacking: limited iron supplies meant these men often fired bone-tipped arrows that struggled to pierce enemy armour. On the battlefield, archers lined up behind slingers - afforded some protection by the shields of the warriors in front of them.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_english_civil_feudalism	With the collapse of the Roman Empire, the Europe of the Middle Ages evolved the Roman villa system into three elements; the feudal system, manorialism and serfdom. Feudalism divided the king's land into territories (or 'fiefs'), which were ruled by vassals in his name. Most of the land in Carolingian Europe was held 'allodially', meaning the  vassal was vested with total control and (importantly) defence of the land in the name of the king. Manorialism legitimised the power they had, as the manor became the centre of local legal and economic authority. The lord of the manor became the most important local figure, his subjects tasked with working the land surrounding his castle. At the bottom of this system (often represented by a triangle with the king at the apex) were the serfs, who were made to work in a system only slightly removed from slavery. The serfs farmed for their own gain, but owed their masters a share of the produce that was grown. They were totally dependant on the lord's land to work, and were legally bound never to leave his service.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_military_land_grants	Unlike the Roman system of military remuneration, little is known about the Sassanids' methods of paying their standing troops. However, it is known that the army worked in a very feudal sense, with authority trickling down from the Shahanshah to the lesser provincial kings, and then to their subjects. Conscription was enforced; men were drawn to fight for their lord because they were expected to. What is known, however, is that the Sassanid government granted several different land tenures; some private, some state-led, and some communal. Whilst this is information gleaned from their agricultural records, the feudal nature of the army implies that the surviving men, once demobilised, would wish to return to a rural life. A tenure from the government would, therefore, provide the perfect payment.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_organised_labour	The desert kingdoms were able to operate due to a complex series of tribal alliances that gave their kings legitimacy. As a result, very little governmental apparatus was centrally controlled; instead, much of it was carried out by royal-appointed viceroys working alongside co-operative nobles at a tribal level. There is evidence to suggest this system was reasonably efficient, as locals new their environment best, so were able to select the most fertile areas and exploit the rich soil to be found there. In order to do this efficiently, it was necessary to make the best use of the available labour force. Local nomads were allowed to graze their animals on suitable spaces in return for working the land. Once the crops had grown, some of the produce was exchanged for some of the animals – enabling new herds to be raised and introducing a wider variety to the population’s diet. In the African Kingdom of Aksum, an early feudal system was already in place alongside slavery based on the raiding and suppression of its weaker neighbours.	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_planned_movement	During late antiquity, there was little attempt by the European powers to stratify and organise their forces in the same way as the Roman army. In the early Middle Ages, however, Carolingian Frankish forces, the Saxons and Lombards gave more thought to their military mechanisms and strategies. For instance, under Charlemagne, Frankish armies became more aggressive and mobile than ever before. Unlike his forebears, who favoured a slow, steady advance, capturing enemy forts and positions along the way, Charlemagne aimed for the heart of his opponents, marching his armies along two or more parallel lines of attack, dividing and conquering, pushing the enemy back into their own territory under pressure. The speed of Charlemagne's attack is what gave his army its edge - he employed forced, long marches, sometimes by  night, in order to completely undo his enemy's preparations. The forced march became a popular element of Carolingian strategies for years to come. The army which could march all night, against the odds and the elements, and remain fresh could deal with anything the enemy could throw at it.	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_military_desert_military_craft	Warfare on the eastern plains and in the deserts, particularly the terrain itself, necessitated the development of specialised tactics, and therefore soldiers trained in the skills needed to use them. The infamous, deadly Parthian Shot – which confounded opponents by appearing to be a retreat until the very final moment, the widespread use of arrows and javelins to skirmish and harass, and the terrifying armoured charge of the mounted cataphracts were all born from the unique topography and arid weather conditions found in the east. Furthermore, by the time of Sassanid Persia and Arab kingdoms such as the Lakhmids, all of these techniques had been in use for several centuries and had won many a battle – even against the well-drilled Roman Legions, who were defeated in detail and annihilated on several occasions as a result. 	true

technologies_long_description_cha_nomad_military_defence_depth	Decisive, pitched battles are not always the best option, especially if you are the outnumbered defender. As borders expanded faster than armies could grow, the idea of "preclusive defence" (a line of border forts and outposts to intercept incursions) became more difficult to maintain. "Defence in depth" was a new concept which allowed the enemy to conquer some ground, but spread them out thinly so they could be dealt with more easily. The defenders then closed around and harassed the weaker portions of the invading army, pushing them back to beyond the borders if not destroying them outright. This defensive strategy was further developed during the Middle Ages with the construction of hill forts and concentric castles, which drew the enemy invaders into layers of defences. Methods such as these exacted a heavy toll on attacking forces, as they repeatedly had to run a gauntlet of missile fire whilst scaling the walls.	true

technologies_long_description_att_barbarian_civil_intensified_agricultural_regime	Serfdom was an institution built upon a long history of oppression. Serfs were peasants, as organised under the developing, proto-feudal system of late antiquity. They lived in servitude, attached to an estate and to the lord or owner of that estate in a condition of bondage known as 'manorialism'. Whilst the status of the Helots in ancient Sparta was similar to that of serfs (though much more severe) it was the labour shortage in the Roman Empire during the 3rd century AD that gave rise to serfdom. In response to the crisis, tenant farmers were employed instead of slaves. However, their social conditions steadily degraded; legislation in AD332 by Emperor Constantine tied 'coloni' to their land and greatly restricted their rights, transforming an already corrupt, abusive relationship into something akin to slavery.	true

By specialising in a particular skill or craft, a man's worth increased exponentially, and the items he produced became far more valuable than the cost of the materials used.

technologies_long_description_cha_english_civil_spoila	Throughout late antiquity and the Middle Ages, great shifts in ideology and territorial ownership meant that many buildings and monuments, rather than being destroyed, were modified or repurposed to better suit their new owners' desires. These modifications could be as simple as carving crosses into stones, as in the case of Roman and Greek temples in the 5th century AD, to ward off demons that resided in the previously pagan structures. The Frankish king, Charlemagne, used similar techniques in his Palatine Chapel at Aachen, taking relics from Rome and Ravenna and building them into the new structure - appropriating the style of the Roman Empire to make it abundantly clear that the Frankish Kingdom was its equal in all respects.	true
technologies_long_description_att_slav_civil_advanced_silverworks_venedi	Due to their transient and mobile nature, the Slavs of late antiquity were not great miners of mineral resources and precious metals. As such, there is no historical evidence of any real Slavic mining activity. However, they did import large amounts of silver; unearthed burial sites have revealed the kinds of things the Slavs hoarded and sent with their dead to the grave. One discovered in Moldova contained myriad pieces of metalwork, including two silver spurs, a silver knife and an ornate silver fibula brooch. Other sites contained silver buttons and beads. Clearly, the Slavs put great importance on their valuable items - perhaps including them in graves as votive offerings for the gods. In order to make these items they became highly adept at working with silver and indeed Slavic silverwork has been found all over Europe, including in the graves of Vikings, who no doubt plundered it from someone else!	true

technologies_long_description_att_eastern_sands_civil_duty_of_conquest	As the desert kingdoms abandoned polytheism, religious figures emerged who became powerful, not only within their faiths, but also within political circles. For instance, Frumentius, a Tyrene slave who went on to become the first Bishop of Aksum, influenced the politics of the region even before he was ordained. As a civil servant, he first converted King Ezana to Christianity and later was regent to the Aksumite crown prince after Ezana's death. During this time he granted Christians religious freedom and, after being ordained and establishing a Holy See, became known as "Abuna" ("Our Father") amongst his congregation. Such was Frumentius' renown and importance to Aksumite politics, future kings refused Roman requests to replace him with someone they felt would better serve Imperial interests.	true
technologies_long_description_cha_celtic_civil_law_code	The laws of the Anglo-Saxon people were inspired by the 'leges barbarorum', which were the early law codes that governed most Germanic societies. However, Anglo-Saxon laws were written in their native tongue as opposed to Latin, and were generally decided by committee, at least at first, rather than being version of Roman law. Anglo-Saxon law was first codified from its oral roots by King Aethelberht of Kent, "according to the examples of the Romans", which most historians take to mean as written down, rather than citing Roman legal precedent. He also decreed that it was to be written in Old English, rather than Latin, which established a tradition which lasted almost five hundred years.	true

technologies_long_description_bel_other_military_military_regionalisation	It was Constantine the Great who, in the 4th century AD, reformed the Roman army, more clearly defining the roles within it, creating specialised function (also shown in the specific names of units), and significantly increasing its overall size. This also promoted regionalisation, as forces dug in at their locations like permanent garrisons. Constantine's reforms further delineated the previously homogenous approach, instead creating smaller clusters that reduced his armies' logistical cost; each force was sent only where it was needed, reducing frivolous expenditure and placing it nearer to necessary production facilities. All of these reforms remained in place amongst the common-sense barbarian kingdoms that inherited the territory of the Western Roman Empire following its collapse at the end of the 5th century AD – local forces who knew the terrain and how best to defend it would be bolstered by larger mobile forces drawn from among the warrior class and conscripts who had little choice who and where they fought.	true

The onager and ballista were still common sights in a siege engineer's arsenal, but so too were newer, more adventurous weapons like the trebuchet and mangonel. Enormous, beam-sling weapons that hurled rocks (or whatever the general chose - even enemy prisoners!) in gigantic arcs before releasing them, created enormous amounts of force with which the attacker hoped to smash down walls or fire over them to destroy the city beyond. However, not always were these weapons the key to victory - at the Siege of Pavia in AD773-4, Charlemagne failed to bring siege equipment to his assault on the Lombard capital, and so the Frankish king was forced to starve the city out. This, combined with a Lombard failure to adequately prepare for the siege, resulted in their capitulation in June of AD774 - such tried and tested methods of old rarely fail, it seems.	true

Expanding on the work of the Academy of Gondishapur (regarded b by many as the world's first hospital), the Umayyads developed what were known as 'bimaristan', or 'houses of the sick', where the sick were treated and looked after. Throughout the Middle Ages, there were further developments (although erratic) in the field of drugs, with the painkilling properties of both poppies and hemp becoming widely known.

The 'Codex Theodosianus', as it was known, took 22 experts nine years to pull together across sixteen volumes, and represented the majority of Rome's legal framework, codified for first time since the foundation of the 'Twelve Tables'. It was not without problems, however. The Codex was hard to properly research, with laws changing even as they were being written. Delays in acquiring information from Rome, Ravenna and private collections made editing it a frustrating process. Nevertheless, the Codex represented a major breakthrough in the documentation of Roman legal processes. It also increased state authority on religious matters, expanding on Christianity's decriminalisation under Constantine and solidly positioning it as Rome's official state religion; one that was intrinsically linked to the role of Emperor.	true
