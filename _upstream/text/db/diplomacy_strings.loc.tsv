diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_04	You speak from deep wisdom although the offer is but shallow. I cannot agree.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_07	I cannot settle on such terms. Your people are worthy, but my people deserve better of our talk.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_accept_begging_03	I will recommend your worthy proposal to those who can ratify it. We are agreed.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_06	I cannot agree, even though the ale calls and the food smells most excellent.	true

diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_client_status_01	Our gods would weep, and rightly, to see us give up our freedom and become your dogs.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_client_status_02	I will not offer up my people as sacrifices to your glory. Ancestors! Strike me down if I ever do!	true

diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_03	You trouble me, but we will do as you ask. Our warriors will go another way.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_02	As you wish. Our warriors will find other paths and not trouble you or your homely women again.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_01	So be it. Your lands are yours alone once more. Let us hope there is wisdom in this.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_requesting_09	Well met! I speak, the devoted servant of my people, to one who we would name a friend.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_requesting_08	I thank you for this audience. You should find the words I bring more than interesting.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_single_payment_01	I hope that this offer of coins will be taken in the right spirit of comradeship and respect!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_single_payment_03	My lord wishes to bestow coin on your people. Accept it as a token of friendship.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_single_payment_02	Take this subsidy. Our treasuries were over-full!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_beg_regular_payment_02	Perhaps I must speak plainly: the Emperor requires your money. There, it is said, and you may, perhaps, pay.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_beg_regular_payment_01	In the name of God, I must ask you to make some small payments to secure the Emperor's continued good opinion.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_requesting_01	I accept in the name of our people. Let this be a sign of more good to come.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_requesting_02	Your offer is fair and honourable. I swear by the gods that, for our part, all will be as we have agreed.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_requesting_03	You have spoken fairly, and I can accept for my people knowing that good will come of the day.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_requesting_04	I can sense that my gods smile on us and our agreement. This is an honourable thing!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_requesting_05	This is fair to my people. All that’s left is to drink until we roll beneath the benches!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_requesting_06	You bless our meeting with these terms. I will show wisdom and accept them.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_personality_desc_long_traditionalist	Memory is his weapon; your past deeds, both good and bad, linger with him, informing his decisions.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_attack_faction_01	A thousand apologies, but such help as we could offer would arrive too late and be of little use.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_attack_faction_03	We cannot. Our armies are but cunning shadows for our defence, not for rash attacks.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_attack_faction_02	We can do little against these people. Our wise men have read the flames, and see no good in them.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_01	My lord’s protection will offer a shelter from the circling carrion birds.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_02	You are wise to seek shelter in our shadow. My master will guide and protect you.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_03	An honourable choice. You have shelter from the storm for as long as you remain faithful servants.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_requesting_10	I seek acceptance on certain matters that could result in common gain for our peoples. Shall we begin?	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_01	Ah, the gods blessed you with a fool's face and a sense of fun! Gold? Now that is for grown-ups…	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_02	So, you think us dotards who will pay because we have no memory of services rendered? Fool!	true

diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_beg_third_party_break_treaty_01	The Emperor wonders why you have a treaty with these creatures? Break it, and be free of obligation!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_03	Do not imagine you can climb into a our bed in search of warmth! Dogs stay in kennels!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_02	Lacking a blind, insane or diseased man to agree with your proposal, you will have to look elsewhere!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_01	Perhaps I should form an alliance with slaves in my vineyards? Or with passing lepers? Bah!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_06	I can almost hear the laughter of the Gods. You have stupidity that would pass for courage to ask such a thing!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_05	You seek a good marriage with us, and yet you have only the charm of an uncommonly ugly fishwife!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_04	Why should a man shackle himself to a corpse, and imagine safety in the act?	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_christian_generic_reject_angry_05	God give me strength! No! O! How I long to strangle you with your own stinking guts!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_christian_generic_reject_angry_02	No, no, by God, no! One day your empty skull will find better use as a drinking cup!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_demand_regular_payment_01	You are overburdened with a large sum that could rightly be lodged in the coffers of the Empire.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_attack_faction_01	Attack these folk? We bear the burdens while you reap the profits, I think! I refuse this stupidity!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_attack_faction_03	I will trample your gizzards into the dust before I ask my lord to risk a single warrior!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_attack_faction_02	Your notion is as wrong-headed as it is cur-like in delivery! Our armies do not bleed for you.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_beg_get_military_off_my_land_01	In the name of the Roman Emperor, I respectfully request that you remove your warriors from our lands, now.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_beg_get_military_off_my_land_02	While your warriors remain on Roman land our Emperor is inconvenienced. Remove them and his digestion will surely improve!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_military_access_03	The Legions require passage through your lands, for purposes both noble and honest. 	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_military_access_02	The Consul requests that his generals be allowed to march their troops across your lands.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_military_access_01	The people require me to ask, politely, if the Legions may enter your lands in pursuit of our legitimate strategies.	true

diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_demand_client_status_02	I will not offer up my people as sacrifices to your glory. Ancestors! Strike me down if I ever do!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_diplomacy_treachery_warning_declare_war_after_peace	Declaring war shortly after signing a peace treaty is considered an act of treachery and is condemned by all factions! (turns remaining: %n)	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_christian_generic_reject_angry_10	God gave you bravery. I will give your manhood to my dogs after any more such witty offerings!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_christian_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_02	A noble act worthy of your ancestors. My people accept your offering.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_03	It takes more than your stolen gold to win our favour. Give it to your remarkably foul gods!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_02	Keep your money. You will need it to pay your way to the afterlife. And it is tainted anyway…	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_01	So, you think we will sell ourselves, like your women? You are truly mad, then, or stupid! 	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_cancel_trade_02	The Emperor has decreed that your merchants should not be welcomed into his territory.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_regular_payment_01	I think not. Our gold would outshine your other treasures' worth a thousand fold, and you would feel shame.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_regular_payment_02	I am sure your needs are urgent, but my lord cannot give away gold he holds in trust.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_regular_payment_03	We do not give subsidies to passing acquaintances. Perhaps that is why our treasury bulges!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_greek_cancel_military_access_02	The sun is clouded when your armies march in our lands. God is troubled. Your armies must go.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_offer_request_cooperation_06	Our ancestors see greatness in you…	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_offer_request_cooperation_04	This is a time for the proud to unite in strength.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_offer_request_cooperation_05	The hungry dogs are all around. The wise man bars his door and looks for allies.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_offer_request_cooperation_02	My ancestors have spoken well of you, and so we offer a treaty.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_hand_over_region_03	These lands are surely mismanaged without Roman order. Do you not have the wisdom hand them over?	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_offer_request_cooperation_03	Brothers are stronger when they stand together.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_hand_over_region_02	The Senators are confident that you will see sense, and hand these lands over for proper and Roman government.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_hand_over_region_01	There is little to be argued in this matter as I am sure you see: these lands are Roman, and should be under our control.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_offer_request_cooperation_01	We can agree here to proper treaties between our peoples. 	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_01	A fancy word for slavery! Keep your whips and chains for your own household, or your wife.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_military_access_01	We do not open our gates to passing ruffians.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_03	You folk, our masters? Fool! Away, back to the other madmen!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_military_access_03	I fear we will now disappoint you. The people would dislike your men kicking up the dust in their lands.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_02	We do not bow before foreign dogs. I would sooner throw my family into the flames than do such a thing!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_military_access_02	And why would we agree to anything so absurd? We are not yet touched by senility and madness!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_greek_reject_hand_over_region_02	God did not give those lands to you. And, while you are worthy, the Lord does not like disobedience.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_vassal_status_01	I cannot agree, my friend. Chance may have been unkind, but the gods have yet to finish their game!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_vassal_status_03	I had not noticed that the gods had cursed us, and ordered that we were to be your chattel goods.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_vassal_status_02	This is not a sensible proposition. Perhaps you have a stolen camel you want me to buy instead? 	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_hand_over_region_02	The Senate bids me ask that you hand over these lands. It is a reasonable request.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_hand_over_region_03	There are few hands safer than those of a Roman and these lands cry out for a Roman's touch.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_hand_over_region_01	I am the agent of the Senate in this simple matter: will you hand over these lands, or not?	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_christian_beg_third_party_attack_03	These people trouble even God himself! I beg you: march against them before it is too late!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_defend_against_faction_03	These people are hungry jackals. Will you spare even one of your glorious armies to fend them off?	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_defend_against_faction_02	We humbly request aid from your glorious armies against this surprisingly determined foe... 	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_defend_against_faction_01	Can you help our defence against these people? I would offer sacrifice in your name if you can!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_christian_not_interested_in_further_discussion_02	Drink, for the love of God, and stop talking for a moment! Your words make my skull throb and burn!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_christian_not_interested_in_further_discussion_05	We have talked until God himself has fallen asleep. And to no purpose. We are finished.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_accept_begging_03	I will recommend your worthy proposal to the Emperor. We are agreed.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_accept_begging_02	God be praised! Let Him bless your wise words and our agreement today!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_accept_begging_06	Your words are loaded with wisdom and foresight. The Emperor will truly see you in a favourable light.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_01	The only golden thing you may have from us on a regular basis is the fillings of my chamberpot!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_02	Find your own money for catamites, whores and trinkets!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_03	Where then, is your begging bowl? Are you crippled? You should play the part to the full, or get nothing…	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_greek_demand_military_access_03	Christ has shown the way for our soldiers. Now, do not defy the Saviour by refusing passage through your lands.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_demanding_03	I fear I betray my people by agreeing, but I have no army of words to oppose it.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_demanding_02	For my people, I accept. If there is fault in this choice, let the gods find it in me.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_demanding_01	Gods above! Witness that my honour is unstained, even as I accept this offer as I must for my people!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_demanding_06	The gods will frown that I have accepted such paltry terms. But I do so knowing that it is necessary.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_demanding_05	I dislike much of our speech, but I put aside my concerns and agree to what must be agreed.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_demanding_04	For the good of my people I say yes, but I would have had more from our talk!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_christian_demand_single_payment_03	While the Lord in Heaven has no use for gold, he knows that his people must flourish and prosper on earth.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_single_payment_03	Our ancestors would be shamed if even one of your coins was accepted. They were proud, our ancestors…	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_single_payment_02	A tidy sum, to be sure, but our hearts are full of courage, not lust for gold.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_single_payment_01	You have the heart of a merchant, my friend. A merchant. We do not want your gold.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_attack_faction_01	My master judges the time is right for an attack on these wretches. Are you ready to carry it out?	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_attack_faction_03	Will you sit, like old men in the shade, until enemies grasp at your throat? Or will you be warriors?	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_attack_faction_02	Will you stand idle? Do these insolent dogs stir nothing in your bellies? Are you turned into women?	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_request_state_gift_02	I ask that you give my people a gift, a token, of friendship.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_request_state_gift_03	You enjoy a fine reputation among my people already, but a gift would make your worth clear even to doubters!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_greek_offer_hand_over_region_02	Our Lord has spoken. These lands are not to be ours, but we wish to give them to friends…	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_request_state_gift_01	You are known as people of wealth and worth. A small gift would make you generous as well!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_client_state_on_table_tooltip_player_side	If the deal is accepted this faction will become your vassal. Vassals act as defensive allies, and pay tributes to their overlord each turn.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_cooperation_01	The gods have decreed that we must walk alone. The alliance is ended.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_cooperation_03	Treaties have served us both well, but now the ancestors tell us to stand alone. We are done with you.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_cooperation_02	Blood and honour has bound us in friendship but now, in honesty, we must walk towards our own fates.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_cooperation_05	The time has come for bonds to be broken. So speak our gods, and so must it be.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_cooperation_04	We have had friendship but now you must find you own feast. Our treaties and agreements are done.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_cooperation_06	You have been worthy allies, but our unquiet ancestors tell us to put aside friendship. This we will do.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_christian_reject_demand_regular_payment_02	Ah, friend, by the Lord this is sorrowful. I was about to ask you the same thing!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_receive_demanding_10	Do not attempt to sweeten truth with honey. Speak plainly. Flatter, and you fail…	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_greek_request_military_access_01	The Lord is a stern general. And at His order, our armies must march in your lands, for a while…	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_02	My people are not your shield. Are you so sunk in cowardice? You are geldings indeed, then!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_03	You have the courage to ask this, yet cannot pick a sword to defend yourselves properly? Great gods!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_01	So… We fight your enemies while you hide, grow fat, and whore yourselves stupid. An excellent plan! Bah!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_01	Such a tribute will be welcomed by my most honourable master. 	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_03	You show generosity. On behalf of my honourable lord, I give you due thanks.	true

diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_receive_demanding_08	Do not waste words. My people are worthy of better.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_receive_demanding_09	I warn you that I have no stomach for the meek or nice.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_cooperation_01	I am certain that, with your famed wisdom, you can see that we benefit from your friendship, and you from ours.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_demand_vassal_status_03	Where is worth in this? You gain rebellion, dissent and bitterness within your walls. We gain nothing.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_cooperation_06	As long as our strength remains, we would be honoured to count you as friends and more.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_demand_vassal_status_02	My ancestors roil in their sleep! That such an offer is made... I must reject your demand.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_demand_vassal_status_01	No! I would not give over even the meanest of our people to your considerate mastery.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_cooperation_04	We are not a friend for the new moon and an enemy in the old. Come, can we not help each other openly?	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_cooperation_05	We are a proud people, and would be proud to count you among our friends.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_receive_demanding_02	Well, why do you trouble my digestion today? 	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_receive_demanding_03	Speak, I will listen before I turn you inside out!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_receive_demanding_01	Speak ill or slowly and I may feed your tongue to the dogs.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_receive_demanding_06	Speak. Do not waste time better spent hunting.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_reject_defend_against_faction_01	I do not think that the Emperor would approve of his troops being used like that. He would think it unmanly.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_receive_demanding_07	My time is better spent hunting than listening, so be quick with your chattering.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_receive_demanding_04	What you say had better please my ears!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_receive_demanding_05	Please, don't bother with meaningless pleasantries. Talk of meat, not honey.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_reject_defend_against_faction_02	Such a plan cannot be countenanced by the Emperor at the moment. You must act without us.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_christian_accept_begging_06	The Lord will rejoice at the words we have spoken today. You honour us with these terms. 	true
diplomacy_strings_string_barb_christian_accept_begging_01	By God, your words are golden truth! I agree with my heart and tongue to all you say!	true

diplomacy_strings_string_personality_desc_short_empire_indifferent	Indifferent with Empires	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_greek_generic_reject_08	No. God has lent you wits and speed in your speech, but was stingy with the truth…	true

diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_08	Come, my friend, speak! We are men of words, and so serve our peoples with honour.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_07	I will be a patient audience for your speech, sure that you come to deliver a profitable message.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_06	Greetings, friend. Let us use our time together in wisdom, and seek accord.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_05	I greet you in my master's feared name. Speak in honesty, and you will be answered likewise.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_greek_generic_reject_02	By God! You show a rare wit in your proposals, but we cannot possibly agree to them.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_04	I greet you as befits your reputation. Now, friend, speak plainly so that we may fall to haggling!	true
diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_03	I will do you the honour of listening to your terms, hoping to hear wisdom and profit in them.	true
diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_greek_generic_reject_04	Your logic cannot be faulted but, somehow, your arguments lack a convincing flavour. I do not agree.	true
