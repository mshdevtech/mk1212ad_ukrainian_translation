unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_hos_turcopoles	The brothers-at-arms were never numerous enough to do more than provide the nucleus of any garrison or contingent.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_ayy_qaraghulam	The mainstay of the Ayyubid army were Kurdish and Turkish horse archers. The Qaraghulam were Ghulam Turkish Horse Archers of the Sultan's central army - in 1181 during the rule of Salahuddin al-Ayyubi, he had 1153 Qaraghulam. (Darakshan Anjum, "State and Civilization Under the Syro-Egyptian Ayyubids (1171-1250). Aligarh Muslim University (2002) p. 72) Note that the "Qara" or black in the name does not denote Black Africans, since Salahuddin has disbanded the old Fatimid army, and mounted archery is the fighting style of the Turks. Most likely, Qara refers to the Turks from the North, denoted by Black in the traditional Turkish Colour-Cardinal Directions association.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_ayy_mamluk_khassakiya	The Khassakiyya Mamluk were the Sultan’s Elite Corps of Bodyguards and select retinue. Most Mamluk Amirs reached their position via membership in the Khassakiyya corps. Al-Qalqashandi adds that they are differentiated by their brocaded tiraz band given to them, and they are admitted to bear their swords in the sultan’s presence, even privately. To be a Khassakiyya, one must be a Mushtarawat or Mamluk bought and freed by the reigning Sultan, and distinguishes himself from the ranks of the Julban. Their number fluctuate over time. At first they numbered 24 to 40 men, then 80, then increased to 400. One source even claim that there were increased to 1000 during the rule of an-Nasir Faraj in the early 15th Century. His successors scaled them down to 80, then 40 again. During the reign of al-Qansuh Ghawri they were increased again to 800 in 1503, and later to 1200 at the Mamluk defeat to the Ottomans in 1517.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_mus_kurdish_cav	Kurdish tribesmen were great cavalrymen and fought as both heavy cavalry and light cavalry.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_khw_khwarazmian_lancers	The Khwarazmian army centered, during the reign of Muhammad II, around a core of elite pagan Turkish cavalrymen from tribal groups such as the Qangli and the Qipchaqs. Due to the marriage of Khwarazmshah Tekesh, father of Muhammad II, to Terken Khatun, a Qangli princess and mother of Muhammad II, the Khwarazmshah could rely on these 'mercenaries' to fight for him in great numbers. They were quite likely the heaviest cavalry of the Muslim world in the early 13th century, with riders wearing heavy armour, usually metal lamellar, and horses covered in complete metal barding. They would become famous for their brutality, savagely plundering Iranian cities as the borders of the Khwarazmids grew. While the favoured weapon of such cavalrymen was the wooden lance, part of the Khwarazmid heavy cavalry fought as horse archers, a role Turkish soldiers filled in great numbers.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_mak_beja_camel_riders	The Beja were most famous for their skill as camel herders. In this capacity, they were a important part of the Nubian army, one that made a gruesome impression on the Arabs they commonly faced in battle.Their weapon of choice was the javelin and they fought mounted on their famous “wine-colored” camels which were prized throughout the Islamic World for their swiftness and trainability. The Bajā often raided the towns of Upper Egypt and Nubia; their swift camels allowed them to withdraw deep into the desert beyond the reach of government forces.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_lat_crossbowmen	The Chronicle of Tocco emphasizes how essential crossbowmen were for the defence of fortifications. In the Frankokratia Greece, the defence of fortresses in Mainland Greece and in the Aegean Sea relied on small companies of mercenary soldiers who were mostly crossbowmen. This is true for the Venetians, and the Angevins in Albania. These crossbowmen are not necessarily Latins - in the 1380s, the duke of Athens Nerio Acciaiuioli employed a Syntrophia (company) of Tzangratores led by Michael Syrianos.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_gen_pavise_crossbowmen	"Genoa's most priced merchandise is not spices or gems, but its crossbowmen" -- Genoese crossbowmen were among the most renowned mercenaries of the time: they were trained and equipped by the Republic, one company always acting as the personal botyguard of the Doge, and showed great professionality, since their reputation directly reflected upon their motherland. Their strict adherence to the terms of the contract had however a negative side: a legend tells that a Genoese company, hired to fight till sunset, fought with honour until sunset, and then left precisely the moment the sun desappeard, even though the battle was still going! Any foreign nation which needlessly endangered or wasted a crossbowmen company was banned from any negotiation with Genoa. In battle, Genoese crossbowmen rain death upon the enemy with their crossbows, finely crafted by the best smiths of the city, and are easily recognised for their "pavese", a great shield decorated with the image of a patron saint or the Red Cross of Genoa, carried upon the shoulders: while reloading, a crossbowman turns his body, presenting the shield to the enemy, and so protecting himself from enemy fire. For their personal protection, they are protected by medium armour, and are quite proficient in the use of the sword.	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_iran_tabardaran	Turkomans were a large part of the late era Iranian military, as tribes first formed a significant part of Timur's armies, but, most importantly, the later dynasties, that of the Qara Qoyunlu and the Aq Qoyunlu, were Turkoman confederations which greatly depended on tribes to provide soldiers for warfare.

In Mamluk era, The harafish represent the lowest element in the strata of Mamluk society, forming guild-like organization in the urban centres of Cairo and Damascus. In context of Mamluk military however, the Ayyubid decentralized organization and Mamluks’ disdain for infantry led them to call what they see as amorphous masses of their infantry this way, even though there are professionals or trained specialists in it.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_hre_konstafler	Konstafler was one of many terms to describe members of special associations of the urban elite, usually merchants but also craft guild aldermen and other prominent citizens, who fought in the town militia as heavy cavalry like aristocratic knights.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_mus_siege_inf	'Siege infantry' denotes soldiers raised by emirs and iqta holders, bound by military service to provide and arm a certain amount of troops, to encircle cities and fortifications, man the siege weapons and assault walls.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_eng_retinue_longbowmen	"I tell you, French cavalry is undefeatable! We are the bes- wait a second, the battle report from Azincourt just arrived, I'm sure we have defeated the English!" -- To encourage longbow practice, each week archery contests were held, and prizes would go to the best marksmen. However, royal recruiters often patrolled such events, and the winners were offered to join the retinue of nobles or the king himself, with promises of fame and loot: for paesants and farmers, such an offer could mean escaping hunger, and becoming very rich. Such archers were trained by the best veterans and equipped by the noble they served. In battle, they were usually deployed in well protected positions, so as to not waste their efforts: a few hundreds of retinue longbowmen could slaughter thousands of enemies in mere minutes, firing with great speed and pinpoint precision. Also, longbowmen usually plunged their arrows into the ground near them before the battle; this had a double advantage: it made reloading easier (the longbow was so big it usually made reaching for the quiver very uncomfortable), and "dirty" arrows usually meant that any enemy they hit would die, either from the arrow or from the infected wound.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_lat_turcopoles	The Turkopoles were always an effective element in an Latin realm army based in the Orient. As early as end 1204 or beginning 1205 Hugues of Tabarie and his brother Raoul as well as Thierry of Termonde arrived from the Holy Land in Constantinople with a large military contingent, including Tourkopouloi. Turks also played a role in the Morea. They were originally used by the Byzantines in their wars against the Princes of Achaia as well as at a much later stage during the period of the Catalan occupation of the Morea (Benjamin Hendrickx, Thekla Sansaridou-Hendrickx, Indigenous and Local Troops and Mercenaries in the Service of the ‘Latin’ Conquerors of the Byzantine Empire After 1204, Journal of Early Christian History, 4:2, pp. 49-50) 	true

The Aziziyya was considerably important in early Mamluk Sultanate, as al-Mu’izz Aybak uses them as a counterbalance to the Bahriyya. (R.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_lat_chevaliers	The Assizes de Romanie and Chronicles of Morea enumerate the baronies of Morea (with the names of their barons), precisely giving the number of fiefs that each barony should have. Then follows the number of vassals that each baron was due to provide for the principality: each ‘great’ baron should have 2 banners (flamoura, banière) and the baron should in person attend, while every fief of the baronnie should provide 1 knight and 2 sergeants on horseback; the other barons who had 4 fiefs, would have 1 banner and 1 knight and 12 sergeants on horseback with his own banner; every knight who had a fief would serve personally and the sergeants who had a ‘serganterie’ too. The Aragonese Chronicle added that a considerable number of fiefs were given to Greeks, but this is not confirmed by other sources. Only the names of barons are given in the Chronicles, and none of them was Greek. One should thus conclude that Greek archontes were to be found among the ‘knights’ and perhaps among the ‘sergeants à cheval’, but not among the barons as such. (Benjamin Hendrickx, Thekla Sansaridou-Hendrickx, Indigenous and Local Troops and Mercenaries in the Service of the ‘Latin’ Conquerors of the Byzantine Empire After 1204, Journal of Early Christian History, 4:2, pp. 45-46)	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_lat_gasmouloi	The Gasmouloi were persons, born after 1204 from a Frankish father and a Greek mother, their name arriving from the French gas (‘guy’) and the Latin mulus (mule). They were either the offspring of married couples or of illegitimate unions (‘bastards’). It appears that they were rejected by the Francs, but accepted by the Byzantines. Therefore it has been accepted that they were ‘pro-Greek’, which explains their acceptance and use in the Byzantine army and especially the Byzantine navy after the recapture of Constantinople by the Byzantines. However, there are also those who were proud of their Frankish origin and were ‘anti-Greek’. It is for instance speculated that the author of the original Chronicle of Morea would have been a Gasmoulos, who was proud to be part of the Frankish establishment.

The Gasmouloi were the result of such unions, and since their loyalty was divided between their two heritages, they were suspected and feared of disloyalty by both Latins and Byzantines. Thus, many of those "mixed" sons had to learn how to fend for themselfes, and were employed as mercenaries by both the Byzantine Empire and the Crusader states. Despite being appreciated for their skills, they were never trusted, and caused many frictions between the Empire and Venice for the way they were treated.	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_ita_condottieri	"Today we fight for this city, tomorrow who knows?..." -- Since Italian city-states could not field huge armies such as France or England, they heavily relied on mercenaries: the most renowned mercenaries of the time were the "condotte". A condotta was a small but perfectly functional army, with infantry, archers, cavalry, and even cannons. They were led by a "condottiero" (the word comes from latin "ducere", meaning " to lead", and is still used in Italian to indicate military leaders and commanding figures), who negotiated with local authorities the price for their services (usually condottieri were loyal to the contract, since none would have hired a condottiero without honour). Condottieri were usually charismatic leaders and cunning generals, since men joined a condotta only if the condottiero was worthy of their service (and able to pay...), and were quick to leave an inept commander. Many condottieri came to fight mainly for just one city, and obtained lands and titles from it for their services, some even becoming its ruler: the most famous example is Francesco Sforza, a "capitano di ventura" (term used to indicate specifically a great leader of a condotta), who for his service for Milan was granted the hand of the only daughter of the last Visconti, becoming Duke of Milan after his death.	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_ita_ronconieri	"A farming tool remains a farming tool even in battle: the harvest is, however, completely different" -- In a world where most levies were mere farmers, thrown into the fray with no equipment nor training, it is no surprise that said farmers usually brought their farming tools with them: after all, while most didn't know which end of a spear to point at the enemy, they were unrivalled masters with scythes, pitchforks, billhooks, and so on. It took little time for generals and blacksmiths to invent weapons based on such tools, so that paesant levies could use actual weapons instead of mere tools, and be easily trained on their use thanks to the familiarity. The bill is one of the most common amongst such weapons: based on the billhook, it is widely used against cavalry, featuring a hook for grabbing a knight's leg and dragging him to the ground, and a sharp blade for killing him once he is dismounted, and usually stunned from the fall.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_alm_muwalladun_cavalry	Andalusians were known for their skills on horseback. The native mixed-heritage Muladi inhabitants of Al-Andalus made very capable cavalry, outfitted in long suits of mail with european-style coifs.Unlike North Africans, most Andalusians regular soldiers since the 11th century wear armour. Murcia was a center or maille and scale corselet making, according to Ibnu Said; and Ibn Quzman mentioned many types of maille, starting from light shirts to double-maille called halaq or muda’afa. This style was discontinued however in the 14th century, as Ibn al-Khatib said that cavalrymen of his day unlike the previous era, wore shorter maille shirt, lighter helmet, North African shields and saddles(Ian Heath, Armies of Feudal Europe 1066-1300 (Wargames Research Group, 1989) p.106)	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_serb_german_maa	German and latin mercenaries started to appear in Serbian armies at the beginning of 14th century. Several companies of Germans were employed over the decades. Best known of them was the contingent of mercenaries from Austria and Slovenia under command of captain Palman from Letinberch which became a elite bodyguard troop of Tsar Stefan Dušan. At least 300 knights and man-at-arms were permanently attached to his court, always at disposal. German men-at-arms fought as heavily armored cavalry, but if needed, on foot as well. Byzantines spoke with envy of these heavy armored men of “exceptional strength and best training”.Indeed, these well organized and trained mercenaries played a prominent role in the Serbian victories of the period. 	true

According to Ibn al-Khatib, during reign of Isma‘il I an engine which work with substance that burns like naft were used to launch burning iron bullets at the siege of Huescar. Furthermore, Spanish sources tell that in the siege of Algeciras 1342-1344 the besieged Muslims threw large arrows and iron bullets using thunder against the Christians (Francisco García Fitz (ed.), João Gouveia Monteiro (ed.), War in the Iberian Peninsula, 700-1600 (Routledge, 2018) p. 17-18, 43)Even though outnumbered and outproduced in gunpowder weapons by their Christian adversaries, the Granadine handgunners were skilled and resourceful.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_byz_pronoiari	"In exchange for land, these men swear to fight for the emperor. What? Did you say feudalism? We are ROMANS, we DO NOT use FEUDALISM!" -- Emperor Alexios I, in his efforts to strengthen the Byzantine empire, created the "Pronoia" system: loyal subjects were granted land by the Emperor, in exchange for their military service in times of need. This can be easily called the Byzantine equivalent of feudalism, the only difference being that these landowners were not given actual political power. Usually the Pronoiai (or "pronoiarii" in the Latin pronounciation) were emplowed as medium infantry and cavalry, but these men are hailed from the upper echelon of the Pronoiai, having received great extensions of land (usually by means of political favours and boot-licking), and as such they can afford the best armours and weapons, putting them almost on the same level as cataphracts.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_hos_mercenary_soldiers	The appeal for colonists made in 1313 envisaged a pattern of settlement based on feudal contracts and adapted from the institutions of Jerusalem and Cyprus. The Hospitallers offered possessions to be held in feudum perpetuum to any who would come from beyond the seas to settle on their side of the sea. Such a knight and his successors would be obliged to maintain a good war-horse and either a good pack-horse (ronsinum) or a mule, and two men, one of them aptus ad arma, either a crossbowman (arbalestarius) or a lance (lancearius). The response was poor, however, and subsequently the Hospitallers did little to encourage the creation of a class of hereditary Latin feudatories. Therefore, The arrangements for military service at Rhodes were almost entirely non-feudal in character. The brethren of the Hospital stationed in the islands and the various classes among the Latin and the Greek inhabitants provided military service in one form or another. The Order employed stipendarii or mercenaries; the stipendaril, such as those on the galleys, were normally bound to the Hospital by an oath of homage: sub sacramento fidelitatis et homagii.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_sic_concergius	"Professional soldiers, directly paid from the royal treasury, these men are Sicily's finest" -- In the feudal army, most soldiers were levied by the king's vassals, the king having not enough money to afford a regular army of his own. This, however, was not Sicily's case: Frederick's reforms strenghtened the king's grip over the territory, and the institution of royal functionaries, tax-collectors and judges granted the royal treasuries a modest, but steady income, enough to afford a small standing army, loyal only to the king. The "conregius" guardsmen, the term meaning "those who stay with the king", form the core of this army: armed with two-handed weapons and medium-to-heavy armour, these men are a sight to behold on the battlefield, cleaving their way through the enemy's ranks with fire-hot fury and ice-cold determination. Their only weakness is their lack of shields, which makes them vulnerable to enemy ranged attacks; also, two-handed weapons are slow and cumbersome to use, and they will suffer losses in prolonged fights against fast-paced swordsmen	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_lat_kastrenoi	Everywhere the Latins left garrisons under a Latin commander. The limited information in the sources shows that a minimum of Latin knights and soldiers manned these castles. While this may have been sufficient for small fortifications, for bigger centres and towns, however, much more men were needed, and one must accept that the old tradition continued to be applied according to which the inhabitants of the kastra, the kastrenoi, were obliged to do some military service to guard the castle. These forces then probably served under their own officers, but still under the general command of the Latin commander of the kastron. This situation was perhaps more common in the Latin Morea, where also Greek burgenses are mentioned.The kastrenoi traditionally had to deliver this servitium because they had a higher status than the ‘simple’ citizens, living in the city outside the protective walls of the akropolis or kastron (Benjamin Hendrickx, Thekla Sansaridou-Hendrickx, Indigenous and Local Troops and Mercenaries in the Service of the ‘Latin’ Conquerors of the Byzantine Empire After 1204, Journal of Early Christian History, 4:2, pp. 47)	true

While "heavy" peltasts usually throw only one or two javelins before engaging the enemy in close combat, "light" peltasts -such as these men- are armed with up to ten javelins, and rain death upon the enemy before retreating and finding more ammunition. Since javelins have shorter range than bows, peltasts are more vulnerable to sudden counter-attacks by other fast moving troops, and they should be kept away from cavalry at all costs.	true

Targonieri are a semi-professional force, trained by the many free cities of Italy to protect themselves from any would-be conqueror, and they fulfill the role perfetly. On the battlefield, they form an unbreakable wall against both cavalry and infantry, laughing as arrows and crossbow bolts harmlessly dot their shields. They are among the few soldiers in Europe trained to fight in phalanx formation, each soldier protecting and helping the other, as the ancient Greek hoplites did: this makes them able to prevail even against èlite forces, better equipped but used to fight as single champions rather than a coordinated force. Their only weakness lies in their weapon: spears are slow weapons, best used defensively, and a wise commander should not waste them against professional swordsmen or two-handed weapon wielders	true

Some even wore surcoats, being indistinguishable from their European opponents except for the Islamic designs on their shields and turbans wrapped around otherwise identical helmets. Al-Turtushi in 12th century describes warriors with armour covering everything except of the eyes (David Nicolle, Man at Arms 348: The Moors 7th-15th Century, Osprey Publishing, p. 21) The Granadine Heavy Cavalry was introduced in number during the rule of Muhammad I, the founder of the Nasrid Imamate of Granada.

Each cavalrymen were said to “had his device which he could always be recognized” – probably referring to the use of heraldry? This style was discontinued however in the 14th century, as Ibn al-Khatib said that cavalrymen of his day unlike the previous era, wore shorter maille shirt, lighter helmet, North African shields and saddles (Ian Heath, Armies of Feudal Europe 1066-1300 (Wargames Research Group, 1989) p.108; Ana Echevarria, Knights on the Frontier: The Moorish Guard of the Kings of Castille 1410-1467 (Brill, 2009) p.91)	true

This led to Sicily being known as a safe haven of tolerance in a world ruled by zealotry and suspicion. Frederick proved himself to be just as open-minded as the rest of the island, showing great respect for every culture and religion, and the muslims population of Sicily show their gratitude and love for the Emperor by fighting side-by-side with infidels, even against other muslims.

Rebellious and unruly, they often clash with the local Berber governments such as the Almohads and Marinids. They were quickly integrated in the army so as to keep them occupied and controlled. During the rule of Caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf, the military value of the Arabs was reflected in their salaries which were higher than those of other troops in the Almohad army. Here, they are represented as light lancers, as Arabs prefers the lance compared to the Berbers who prefers the Javelins and the Turks with the bows. (Pascal Buresi, Hicham El Aallaoui, Travis Bruce.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_all_sergeants	"To be ranked a servant may seem ridiculous to a noble, but for most, it is the best they can hope to achieve" -- Coming from the Latin term "servientem", meaning "servant", sergeant is a rank used in almost every European army of the time (and still today). While each nation had its own technical meaning for the rank, generally the sergeant was the highest rank a low-born commoner could aspire to, since all higher offices were reserved for the nobles. Being promoted sergeant required that a soldier had survived many battles, and had performed many acts of valour (usually visible from the scars most sergeants sported), and meant better equipment and a higher salary (usually a larger part of the loot), which for most soldiers could mean the difference between returning to their homes as a serf and becoming an actual free land-owner. Usually sergeants oversaw training and equipment of small units, and led them in battle. Sometimes, sergeants were grouped together and used as a powerful fist to break the enemy lines, or to defend a focal point: well armed and experienced, these veterans are not to be underestimated.	true

By the mid 14th century the main weapon of Swiss foot-soldiers was the halberd but some nasty experiences when confronted by dismounted men-at-arms armed with long lances at Sempach and at Abredo led to the widespread adoption of the pike. In the halberd era the Swiss tended to draw up in a keil (wedge) formation – actually an unusually deep column rather than a wedge – as at Laupen and Sempach, or, in the face of cavalry, in a square as at Abredo.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_ghu_ghulaman_i_saltan	The biggest change in the military history of the Ghurid sultanate was the complete change from a mainly native-born fighting force of Ghori tribesmen to an almost complete army of cavalrymen by Mu'izz ad-Din. Finding the Ghori troops untrustworthy, he purchased very large quantities of slaves, who, history would show, were not only much more effective in combat, but also incredibly loyal. Ghulaman in the Muslim world were first and foremost used as horse archers, but Mu'izz ad-Din would generally prefer to use them as a large core of heavily armoured shock cavalry. The true elite of the Ghurid military, the Ghulaman-i-saltan ('Ghulams of the Sultan') were numbered at roughly 12 000 at Tara'in in 1192, wearing heavy armour and riding armoured (bar-gustuwani) horses. These soldiers, due to their military success, became iconic in the Ghurid realm, with coins showing such cavalrymen on one side from Afghanistan to Bengal.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_swi_t3_pikemen	Langspiesser (literally long-spearmen) were the defining soldiers of 15th century Swiss armies. In the wake of their defeat at Arbedo, the Swiss Cantons started systematically drilling their fighting men in the use of the pike. Deployed in a dense square called Gewalthaufen, Swiss pikemen were feared for the speed, discipline and fearlessness with which they advanced and attacked the enemy, followed by halberds and other shorter polearms that hacked enemies apart that had been overpowered by the massed pikes. As many Swiss soldiers fought part-time with civilian occupations and fields that they had to return to after campaigning, they favoured this uniquely aggressive and brutal type of fighting in which the swift neutralisation of the enemy as a threat was prefered to the gathering of ransoms and lengthy campaigning.	true

Mounted Sarbaazan (soldiers) are shown, in miniatures, as wielding a weapon in one hand, quite commonly a sword, and a round sipar shield in the other, generally made of hardened leather. A kalkan shield (wicker shield) would have been a possibility. The tabarzin, or saddle axe, was also a very popular weapon amongst Eastern Muslim cavalrymen in the medieval era.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_oman_murtaziqa	The first possible recorded instance of Mercenaries serving an Omani Imam was in the reign of Imam al Muhanna bin Jayfar (840-851 AD). During the Julanda revolt, Ahmad al-Izkawi in Misbah al-Zalam indicated that the Army of Sohar sent against them included Indians. There is not enough detailed information about the "Hindi" army to know whether they were Indians who lived in Sohar or been brought from Sind as Mercenaries. ('Ism 'Ali Ahmed al-Rawas, Early Islamic Oman - (ca - 622/280-893) a Political History (University of Durham, October 1990) p. 264-265)Between the political doctrines of the Ibadi, there were the Shira, and the Difa. Shira was based on Qur’anic verses which speak of men selling themselves and their goods in this life for God's cause in return for God's pleasure and for Paradise. It It involved Khuruj , coming out against oppression and tyranny, where the Shurah are assembled under the leadership of an Imam. The defensive Difa' situation was more or less an extension of the Shira, when Khuruj expanded to war, or when the Ibadis were attacked. A military leader could be elected, Imam al-Difa', but his authority was restricted. Only the Imam az-Zuhur had all the authority, rights and Obligations reserved to the office. He could call uponall able-bodied men to fight, and could reinforce this army with slaves when required. The later Yaarubid Dynasty maintain a standing Mercenary and Slave army, even though highly criticized due to Ibadi's rejection of standing army under a ruler, as later the Shurah died out (Patricia Risso Dubuisson, A history of Uman and Masqat, c. 1750-1800.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_mag_uluj	Over the course of the Middle Ages, from the eighth to the fifteenth centuries, thousands of Christian soldiers from the Iberian Peninsula traversed the Mediterranean to serve in the armies and courts of Muslim rulers in al-Andalus and North Africa. Not only did the use of Christian soldiers by these Islamic kingdoms span a period of centuries, the practice is also well documented in both Latin and Arabic sources. According to al-Umari in the 14th century, the Marinid army employed 4000 Franks. Ibn Khaldun recorded that Maghribi realms employ Christian Foreign Legions as an anchor to their battle lines, to hold firm in close formation as a place for the roaming hit-and-run Maghribi cavalry can retreat into safety. The Maghribi realms does this because even if this means employing infidels, Europeans were the best people they know of for close-rank fighting in formation. However, they were best used for Muslim vs Muslim wars; not in wars against Christians because they might defect!

Greek fire was able to burn both on and under water, making it a highly-effective naval weapon, but one which could easily get out of control and destroy its users. Those brave enough to try could create a sheet of flame that rapidly consumed any ships it touched.	true

In distinction from dependent servants occupied in the noble household, dvoryane were called "free servants" [вольными слугами]. In the 14th cent. a feudal lord would grant them land for service. The dvoryane and deti boyarskie from the court of Ivan III and Vasili III became the new core of Muscovite cavalry forces, reducing the dependence on the more fickle service of other knyaz and boyars, increasing central control over the army. In the reign of Ivan IV, dvoryane could range from generals with vast estates to humble gentry with only a single peasant household on their land. [MacKenzie, David and Michael Curran.

And I will be obedient to you, and to your successors, even unto death." -- The Ritterbrüder are the highest ranking members of the Teutonic Order, taking an additional vow of chastity: usually members of great German noble houses, these men fear no enemy, both in politics and on the battlefield. Armed and equipped with the finest products of the Empire's most renowned blacksmiths, the Ritterbrüder ride into battle atop powerful steeds, pride and joy of generations of breeding.Their charge can shatter all but the most stubborn pike formations, and usually their enemies don't even try to resist, breaking formation in a desperate attempt to flee their doom, only to be trampled upon by their stallions. The Ritterbrüder however aren't invincible, as all this armour makes their charge quite slow: as such, light skirmishers can safely shower them in arrows and javelins, only to retreat when the Ritterbrüder try to chase them. Thus, they must be supported by light troops, otherwise they might find themselves cornered and taken out one by one by a cunning foe.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_sic_frederick_ii	"King of Sicily and soon-to-be Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, the world shall kneel in awe before the "stupor mundi", or hide in fear!" -- Frederick II is the son of Henry VI, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and Costanza d'Altavilla, only daughter (and thus heir) of the last King of Sicily; following his father's death he first became King of Sicily, and with the death of the newly crowned emperor, Otto IV, he united both kingdoms under his rule as a "personal union", meaning that the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Sicily were separate states, coincidentially ruled by the same person. Skilled general, clever diplomat and politician, and patron of literature and figurative arts, Frederick was nicknamed "stupor mundi", meaning "world's marvel", for the ability he showed in everything he did. Considering Sicily his true homeland, he ruled his empire from the Sicilian city of Palermo, and transformed southern Italy into a hub of knowledge and trade, bringing those lands a prosperity unseen from the Roman times, with the help of a loyal and competent administration and an adoring population. The same men who led the administration also founded the famous "scuola siciliana", the sicilian school of poetry, alternating between legal counsel and sonnets or endecasyllabes: for this reason his court was known as the "corte dei miracoli", the court of wonders, and it comprised even a "serraglio", the ancestor of modern-day zoo, full of exotic beasts. As much as he loved Sicily, he utterly ignored Germany, leaving the always quarreling german nobles free to do whatever they wanted, and thus undermining Imperial rule and authority: his successors never managed to repair the damage, and this led to the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire into a puzzle of semi-independent principalities	true

Genoa's political life, however, wasn't as "serene" as Venice, and civil strife and economical rivalry caused the death or exile of many Doges and prominent politicians. As such, the task that befalls on Genoese bodyguards is much heavier than their foreign counterparts, since they have to protect their general from both friend and foe! Genoese bodyguards are highly trained and equipped with the most finely crafted weapons and armours the Republic can pay (and the Republich is very, very rich).

The Tamīmahs would meet and form alliances with other tribes in which the alliance would be headed by the most powerful. The leadership’s orientation would be either tribal/political or tribal/religious. All these elements would then come under an overall leader called Zaʿīm al-Qabāʾil al-Akbar (“The Paramount Chief of the Tribes”).

Their skill with weapons and unwavering loyalty -especially the latter- made them stand out in the eyes of the Emperor, who didn't trust his bodyguards, and following in a long tradition of nations who employed foreign warriors as bodyguards -such as the Ellenistic monarchies and the Arab states of Spain- the most skilled and loyal among the Varangoi were elevated to the position of personal guard of the Emperor, their office becoming hereditary -the son of a Varangian Guard would become a Guard with the death or retirement of his father-. Clad in heavy armour from the best forges in Constantinople, and wielding their trusted two-handed axes, the Varangian Guard is a nightmare for any enemy: they fight with the fury and speed of their ancestors, a whirlwind of steel capable of splitting a soldier in half from head to waist, and with the cunning and experience of a veteran, not allowing their emotions to blind them.

Actually, they enjoy it: this is true wisdom!" -- Coming from the Latin term "servientem", meaning "servant", sergeant is a rank used in almost every European army of the time (and still today). While each nation had its own technical meaning for the rank, generally the sergeant was the highest rank a low-born commoner could aspire to, since all higher offices were reserved for the nobles. Being promoted sergeant required that a soldier had survived many battles, and had performed many acts of valour (usually visible from the scars most sergeants sported), and meant better equipment and a higher salary (usually a larger part of the loot), which for most soldiers could mean the difference between returning to their homes as a serf and becoming an actual free land-owner. Usually sergeants oversaw training and equipment of small units, and led them in battle. Sometimes, sergeants were grouped together and used as a powerful fist to break the enemy lines, or to defend a focal point: well armed and experienced, these veterans are not to be underestimated.	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_georg_kipchak_mercenaries	From the twelfth to the thirteenth centuries, Georgian monarchs recruited thousands of Q’ipchak/Cuman mercenaries and successfully used their services against neighboring states. The Georgian King David IV “the Builder” (1089-1125), employed tens of thousands of Cuman-Q’ipchak soldiers and settled them in his kingdom in 1118. The settlers received land plots, summer and winter pastures, and committed themselves to sup-ply one warrior from each family.  The Cumans settled down both in the central and eastern regions of Georgia as well as in Northern Armenia, contacting closely with the local population. David married a Cuman-Q’ipchak princess, Gurandukht, daughter of Khan Otrok and invited his new in-laws to settle in Georgia. The Qipchaks remaining in the Georgian kingdom continued their military service achieving high positions at the Georgian Court. The military commander Khubasar at the time of Giorgi III (1156- 1184) and Queen Tamar (1184-1207), though for a short time, held the position of the Amirspasalar. Tamar and her successor, Giorgi Lasha (1213-1223), continued to employ Cuman-Q’ipchak mercenaries. They were referred to by the Georgians as “Q’ipchakni akhalni” (“new Q’ipchaks”)  to distinguish the newly arrived from the old settlers. ("Kartlis Tskhovreba".

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_lat_militiai	The existence of Greek militias and other troops in Constantinople in the service of the Latin emperors cannot be doubted. They may have taken several forms: (a) as guild militias, (b) as military service imposed on some groups of citizens, and (c) as formal troops. In Byzantium – as in the Western medieval cities – guilds had their own militia. While in the West these guild militias formed the corn of the military power of the cities (which strived at autonomy, if not virtual independence), in Byzantium they remained subjected to the Emperor. The guilds survived under Latin rule.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_mag_jund_al_nasara	Christian knights found their services just as useful to Islamic rulers as certain Berber and Andalusian contingents found the same to be true about Christian kings. After all, Rodrigo Diaz el Vivar himself famously served both Christian and Muslim lords, to take an example from earlier times. From the twelfth century to the sixteenth, North African regimes of all types frequently hired Christian mercenary soldiers to defend their persons and fill the gap of their armies neither Berbers, Arabs, nor Andalusi can fill: Heavy Cavalry. The Almohads, Hafsid, Zayyanid, and Marinid dynasties all established Christian mercenary guards over the course of the thirteenth century. These Christian Europeans in Maghrebi service were called by various names, starting with the rather neutral “Nasara” or “ar-Rum”; but also the derogatory“‘Uluj” – “Barbarians”, “Riff-raff”; or “Farkhan”. The original meaning of the Arabic word farkh is “little bird.”In a pejorative register, it could have the sense of “young man” or even “bastard.” North African and Andalusi Muslims used the term to refer to Christian mercenary soldiers.The word later entered Spanish as farfan (plural farfanes) which describes these men who were willing to trade sides in the wars that regularly ravaged the region. It is important to differentiate these Christian mercenaries in North Africa, the ones mentioned in conjunction with descriptions of the royal entourage (biṭāna, dāʾira, ḥāshiya, khāṣṣa, ʿabīd al-dār, or sanīʿa), are not just a short-term contractual mercenary, but thought of as a foreign legion in possession of the royal court. Only the monarch had the authority to recruit avowed “enemies of the faith” as personal bodyguards and soldiers. Though there were some prominent cases of apostasy, the vast majority of medieval European mercenaries in North Africa retained their Christian identities.

Migrations of Afghans into Hindustan accelerated following the Mongol conquest of that region and Muslim rulers in India were quite eager to find place for Muslims whose affinity was mostly to these Afghan or Turkish nobles. A great number of Afghans were hired as mercenaries and were an important part in maintaining Afghan (or Pathan as they would later be called) or Persianate dynasties across India.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_byz_latinkon	"The Franks don't even now the meaning of "personal hygiene", but in battle they more than make up for it" -- The Byzantines despised everyone who was not Byzantine, seeing themselves as the only true heirs of the old Roman ways. As such, the Western Europeans were seen as barbaric upstarts, as well as heretics for embracing the doctrines of the bishop of Rome-, usurping the lands of the Roman Empire, their sole existence an insult to its memory. As such, relationships between the Byzantine Empire and the European states were strained at best, and Byzantine emissaries often worked to sow the seeds of rebellion and war between these nations, following the old Roman ways of "divide et impera" in the hope of, one day, retaking control of Europe. In the wake of the 12th century, however, the Empire is weaker then ever, and its need for new soldiers is enough to forget the hate, if just for a while: thus, the "Latinikon" is born, a heavy cavalry unit formed exclusively by Western soldiers -"Latins" being a synonym for Franks-, often descendant of western immigrates residing in the Empire. These men are equipped, and fight, in the western way, and their charge is a deadly danger for any foe save pikemen and other heavy cavalry	true

Regardless, Muslim rulers found Ghulaman to be indispensable for both their protection and to counter-balance the ambitions of powerful amirs.

For Sicily, this ended with an agreement between the Pope, formal sovereign of Sicily (the Norman kings conquered Sicily from the muslims by the Pope's order, and ruled it as his vassals), and France: the French king's brother, Charles of Anjou, would become king of Sicily, in exchange for regular tributes to the Pope. Charles invaded Sicily in 1266, and killed in battle Conrad, last of Frederick's heirs, thus ending the house of Hohenstaufen. In 1282 however, after French officers raped a married woman in front of a church during the Easter festivities, the population began a furious uprising: thousands of French soldiers and settlers were massacred mercilessly, and the new king was forced to flee in a hurry from the island, transferring the capital to the city of Naples.

Not only did the use of Christian soldiers by these Islamic kingdoms span a period of centuries, the practice is also well documented in both Latin and Arabic sources. According to al-Umari in the 14th century, the Marinid army employed 4000 Franks. Ibn Khaldun recorded that Maghribi realms employ Christian Foreign Legions as an anchor to their battle lines, to hold firm in close formation as a place for the roaming hit-and-run Maghribi cavalry can retreat into safety. The Maghribi realms does this because even if this means employing infidels, Europeans were the best people they know of for close-rank fighting in formation. However, they were best used for Muslim vs Muslim wars; not in wars against Christians because they might defect!

These men were expected to protect their homes by themselves, and were given little training and equipment, not being expected to do much more than holding off the enemy for a while before dying or fleeing. Italian militias were different, for they were volunteers who trained in certain days of the week, while still having jobs and families of their own, and were equipped by the city (or, in big cities, by their district of birth): as such, they firmly believe in their role of protectors of the city, which they show in painting the city's emblem or patron saint on their shield, and with medium armour and training they are not to be underestimated, though they will probably be slaughtered against professional soldiers	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_oar_longship_small_t1_cel	Literally meaning ‘long ship’ in the Gaelic language, the ‘long fhada’ can claim heritage from the ancient shipbuilding tradition of the Nordic peoples. Of course, the Norsemen didn’t just give their prized technology away, but their persistent raids of the Scottish and Irish coasts meant that longships were sometimes captured, enabling the Celts to study their construction in depth. Eventually, they produced the ‘birlinn’ and ‘Irish galley’, variants on the longship with between eight and twelve oars, in addition to a large sail. These features allowed the new breed of Celtic ships to easily cross the open sea for the purposes of trade and war, rather than having to remain close to the coastline at all times. Unfortunately, no remains of Celtic long fhada survive to this day, despite records of their continuous use until the 17th century.	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_ayy_mamluk_julban	The Mushtarawat, or Ajlab or Julban in Circassian Mamluk era, “Recruits” were the Mamluks who were bought and freed by the reigning Sultan. Therefore, they have a tighter knit of solidarity than the other Sultan’s Mamluks originating from the previous Sultan nor those taken from the Amirs. And such, the Sultans show heavy favoritism towards them, as they form the main support base of the current Sultan. Therefore the newly ruling Sultan will gradually replace the position of the Qaranisa Mamluk with his own Mushtarawat to secure his power. They even held back in battles to preserve their numbers compared to the Qaranisa. Due to their newly recruited status the Julban lack experience compared to the other Mamluks, but their privileged position means infractions are merely punished lightly. This lead them in the later era to be known as corrupt bullies.

After they fell from power, they were still referred as "Abid", so it is difficult to distinguish between the free Habashi descendants, slaves, and the low-status segregated al-Akhdam. (Venetia Ann Porter. The History and Monuments of the Tahirid dynasty of the Yemen 858-923/1454-1517, p. 39-40)In the Tahirid era, these Habeshi slave soldiers forms the most reliable and trusted element of the Tahirid army. Ludovico di Varthema in 1504 stated: "The sultan took to the field and marched to the said city of Sane a with his army, in which there were three thousand horsemen, sons of Christians, as black as Moors [ie Ethiopians]. They were those of Prester John, whom they purchased at the age of eight or nine years, and had them trained to arms. These constituted his own guard, because they were worth more than the rest of the eighty thousand". (Venetia Ann Porter.

Years of civil strife have left the Empire weakened: the army is decimated, countless cities have been sacked and razed to the ground, and the bureaucracy is more corrupt than ever. Outside, enemies approach: the Crusader states have been defeated, the Templars have returned to Europe and the Hospitallers fight a losing war from their fortress-island of Rhodes. Every day the Turks advance more. Rumors tell of a blasphemous weapon, black powder turning into fire, bringing down even the mightiest walls: they say even the Theodosian walls, built almost a thousand years ago, and protecting our city from dozens of attacks, will fall against such magic. What should the Emperor do? Some say He should fortify the borders and entrench himself in the capital, challenging the enemy to bring down walls sturdier than the very ramparts of Troy. Others think He should order an all-out attack, a desperate offensive in the hope of catching the enemy unprepared, thus securing the borders and teaching everyone that the the heritage of Rome still lives on. Whatever the decision, it will take the spirit of the great Romans of old to even hope of surviving the coming tide, and from there, rebuild an Empire worthy of the dream of Romulus.	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_oman_shurah	The Youth Volunteers of the Ibadi called themselves "As-Shurah", or "The Exchangers" as the ones that exchanged the mortal life for the afterlife. The Ibadis have always disapproved of the existence of a professional army, fearing that the elected imam might become a despot. The shurāt represented the basic principleof the state’s military organisation in the Ibāḍī imamate of Oman. This very simple principle stated that, as every Muslim is legally obliged to support a just Imam and to assist him against the enemies of the Ummah. (Abdulrahman al-Salimi, "The Political Organization of Oman from the Second Imamate Period to the Yaʻrūba: Rereading Omani Internal Sources" L’ibadisme dans les sociétés de l’Islam médiéval: Modèles et interactions, Degruyter (2018) p. 114) However, if war cannot be avoided, an army of volunteers and enlisted men drawn from the sons of the tribes shall be assembled, as the defence of the imamah is both a national obligation and a religious duty. (Hussein Ghubash, Oman - The Islamic Democratic Tradition (Routledge, 2006) p. 42-43.) The Ibadi Shurah military volunteers was divided to 200 to 400 men strong units, subdivided into groups consisting of ten men. At the head of each group was an educator (mu'addib) whose duty it was to teach the Ibadi doctrine and the principles of what is acceptable according to custom (ma`ruf). Every individual involved in the shurah received monthly payment of seven dirhams. Al-Salimi mentions that the low wages tended to prohibit most of the shurah from marrying; Sheikhs of Basra later produced a fatwa reducing women's dowries to ten dirhams and thus enabling the shurah to get married.

While the most famous pikemen come from Switzerland and Flanders, and are rightly renowed all across Europe, every nation deploys its own pike companies. A wise commander will deploy pikemen in the center, their sides well protected, for pikemen suffer from flank and rear attacks more than any other troops, and will provide them ranged support against enemy archers, since they don't have shields.	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_mag_uluj_infantry	Ibn Khaldun recorded that Maghribi realms employ Christian Foreign Legions as an anchor to their battle lines, to hold firm in close formation as a place for the roaming hit-and-run Maghribi cavalry can retreat into safety. The Maghribi realms does this because even if this means employing infidels, Europeans were the best people they know of for close-rank fighting in formation. However, they were only used for Muslim vs Muslim wars; not in wars against Christians because they might defect! (Abd Ar Rahman bin Muhammad ibn Khaldun, ‘Al-Muqaddimah’ Chapter III, Section 35 on Wars and the methods of waging war practiced by the various nations) Over the course of the Middle Ages, from the eighth to the fifteenth centuries, thousands of Christian soldiers from the Iberian Peninsula traversed the Mediterranean to serve in the armies and courts of Muslim rulers in al-Andalus and North Africa. Not only did the use of Christian soldiers by these Islamic kingdoms span a period of centuries, the practice is also well documented in both Latin and Arabic sources (Globalization of Knowledge in the Post-Antique Mediterranean, 700–1500, p. 102)	true

Also referred to administrative servants of the same kind of origin. In the High Middle Ages many princes armed and equipped their serfs as soldiers and some as cavalry.  Many of these were knighted even though they and their offspring still technically retained serf status. Many ministerials became functionaries, courtiers, or civil servants as well as soldiers. Over time ministerial families established themselves in the gentry and in some cases titled nobility.  By the 15th Century ministerial families made up a lot of the knightly class and were serfs in name only.  Though equivalent soldiers existed in other regions, the term ministerial is used almost exclusively in a German cultural context.	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_mag_berber_horsemen	North Africans' fabled skill as light cavalry has been legendary since the ancient times. From the Numidian Cavalry of the Punic Wars, the Mauri Auxilia of the Roman Empire, into the Zenata cavalry in which their name in Spanish, "Jinete" became a word for horsemanship itself in that language. In the Almohad Taqdim, the term used to refer to the troops recruited from the varied Berber tribes were the "Asnaf al-Berber", lit. variety of Berbers. Other terms amongst other simply "Qaba'il min al-Ra'iyya" (Tribes from amongst the subjects). Until the reign of Muhammad al-Nasir, the troops from ex-Almoravid tribes such as the Zenata and Masmuda were inserted to the "Hasham".

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_eng_billmen	"A farming tool remains a farming tool even in battle: the harvest is, however, completely different" -- In a world where most levies were mere farmers, thrown into the fray with no equipment nor training, it is no surprise that said farmers usually brought their farming tools with them: after all, while most didn't know which end of a spear to point at the enemy, they were unrivalled masters with scythes, pitchforks, billhooks, and so on. It took little time for generals and blacksmiths to invent weapons based on such tools, so that paesant levies could use actual weapons instead of mere tools, and be easily trained on their use thanks to the familiarity. The bill is one of the most common amongst such weapons: based on the billhook, it is widely used against cavalry, featuring a hook for grabbing a knight's leg and dragging him to the ground, and a sharp blade for killing him once he is dismounted, and usually stunned from the fall. Billmen levies are thus effective and cheap anti-cavalry forces. Actual training and equipment only add to their worth.	true

Usually, they were hunted like ferocious beasts (wich they resembled for their vicious ways), but in times of war they were higly priced for their fearlessness and ferocity, and were used to strike fear in the local population, pillaging, murdering and raping anyone and anything they could. Due to their role of fast-hitting infantry or cavalry, they are lightly armoured, but wield fearsome weapons such as spiked maces, which they use to inflict grievous wounds upon anyone unlucky enough to stand against them.

This is not the case in reality, as wise medieval commanders were aware of the potential residing in ranged warfare, and organized archers and crossbowmen so that they could efficiently support their infantry. As the European powers discovered military standardization and organization, ranged forces received better equipment and training, and were assembled in companies: each company had a serjeant, whose duty was to oversee the training and equipment for the rookies and, in battle, direct the fire where it would be most effective. Often ranged serjeants were banded together as an èlite archer or crossbowmen company, and used to eradicate high-priority targets with pinpoint accuracy.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_all_skirm	"A javelin is a metaphor for life: it goes up fast, it goes down even faster, then it hits you in the face, and then you die." -- In times of war, every able bodied is expected to fight for his lord, be it rich or poor. Those too poor to afford even the cheapest form of armour and weaponry are listed in the skirmishers: without armour, save for a helmet and a small shield made of scrap material, and too unskilled to use bows, these men use javelines to hit the enemy from the distance. Even in their hands, javelines are still deadly weapons, capable of killing even an armoured swordsman, and their light equipment (further enhanced by their cowardice) means they can easily retreat from any pursuing infantry, harassing them in the process. However, should they be forced to fight, or hunted down by cavalry, the best a commander can do is pray for their souls	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_serb_despot	After disastrous Ottoman defeat at Ankara in 1402. Serbia was independent once again. As sign of his new status knez Stefan Lazarević received title of Despot from Byzantine emperor. Originally it was a senior Byzantine court title, or title of ruler of vassal state, but this time empire had no control or influence over Serbia. Despots managed to break power of the high nobility (vlastela) - their power was now unquestioned. Financed by the rich gold and silver mines, state was consolidated, and military capabilities increased.By 15th century Hungary became main source of inspiration on military matters. Despot’s guards, all professional soldiers and seasoned veterans, wore full plate armor and were almost indistinguishable from Hungarian knights.	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_ayy_halqa	Ajnad al-Halqa were the non-mamluk cavalry force of the Mamluk Sultanate, recruited from native Egyptians and sons of Mamluk. Once the elites of the Ayyubid army, they fell into mere sidekicks of the Mamluks and garrison guards. Due to the fief redistributions, their lands dwindles to the point that in the late 14th century some of them cannot afford horses anymore, therefore must serve alongside the Mamluks as infantry. The constant deterioration of the Halqa reached to a point where most of the Halqa were considered unfit for duty  (David Ayalon, Studies on the Structure of the Mamluk Army II, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol.15, No. 3 (1953), pp. 451-456; Heath, Ian, "Armies of the Middle Ages, Volume 2: The Ottoman Empire, The Eastern Europe, and the Near East 1300-1500" (Wargames Research Group, 1984) p. 41-42)  	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_eur_knights	These knights dominate both society and the battlefield in medieval Europe. Under the feudal system each man owes military service to his lord in return for protection, a grant of land, and the peasants to work it. Trained as warriors from birth, their favourite tactic is the headlong charge. Despite the simple tactics, their strong armour, heavy lances, and martial prowess mean that only the most resolute can resist them	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_alm_abid_al_makhzan	As the Almohad army grew to use more and more Sahelian African slaves to supplement their armies (from the region that is now Mali and Mauritania), they eventually began to pad out their personal bodyguards with crack squads of Black slave-soldiers. Ibn Tumart dubbed one of these groups the 'Abid al Makhzan', or "The Servants of the Government", recorded serving until 1266, the tail end of the Almohads.Their most famous action was in Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, where they fought to the death defending Caliph Muhammad an-Nasir's tent against the charge of Antso VII of Navarre. The Hafsids also retained the Janawa (Guinea) black guards, dressed in white robes and spears with silk pennons	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_alm_abid_infantry	'Abid refers in this period, to black slave-soldiers, drawn up from the semi-sedentary tribes of the interior. They were poorly equipped and yet, intensely loyal. Some would graduate to the ranks of elite bodyguards for powerful leaders but most fought and died as press-ganged troops whipped up in massive numbers simply to bloat the size of the army.	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_arab_hushud	Throughout the Sharḥ dīwān, we frequently read in stories and reports of battles words that provide the meaning of assembling or gathering troops, such as ḥashad, jamaʿa and inḍamma; this indicates that a large number of soldiers were not professionals but rather temporary or amateur soldiers who were levied at the time of defensive or offensive battles. They were likely to have been slaves, farmers, pearl divers or other labourers.

unit_description_short_texts_text_mk_gran_hushud	The Hushud were levies through mandatory and extraordinary recruitment for a specific campaign, who, once the expedition had ended, returned to their normal activities. They were only paid for the duration of the campaign, and poorly at that. In certain periods of Andalusi history, this recruitment could be avoided by paying a certain tax, used in turn to hire mercenaries. 	true
