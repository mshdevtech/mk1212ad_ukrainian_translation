dilemmas_localised_description_cha_dilemma_viking_1_cha_fact_northumbria	Tired of your endless raids, the Northumbrian king seeks a new agreement with you, whereby your attacks cease in return for payment.

dilemmas_localised_description_slav_dilemma_anteans_1	Chilibidius, as promised, has been brought before you and made to restate his position – he claims to be a Roman general of quite some prestige.

dilemmas_localised_description_slav_dilemma_anteans_2	Dire news, lord! Chilibidius, the slave general we recently sent back to Rome, has been proven nothing but a liar!

dilemmas_localised_description_att_bel_request_justinian_photius_1	Ave, Belisarius! It is so often the case that the man who distinguishes himself most highly in battle finds himself losing the same struggle in his very home. One thinks of King Ahab, mighty in battle and politics, so under the sway of his evil wife, Jezebel, that God destroyed him and brought low his kingdom.\\n\\nSo you see a matter that seems private and outside the remit of the sovereign is in fact a matter closely entwined with the fortunes of Empire. Belisarius, you are aware that your importance is second to none. It is only right, therefore, that you are scrutinised above all others. Your wife, Antonina, has been stirring scandal for some time in the capital. Some of my most valuable agents have been undermined by her behaviour and I hear that her latest scheme is directed at her own son! I will tolerate it no longer.\\n\\nIt pains me to send such an ultimatum to one who has served me so well, but I am confident that this action will benefit you above all others. You must shun the council of your wife. That is all.	true

Acceptance of this deal will mean peace between your two peoples, but of course you could accept it and betray him later! Perhaps he means to do the same?

dilemmas_localised_description_att_bel_request_theodosia_ioannina_1	My heartiest congratulations, Belisarius, on the news of your daughter’s impending matrimony! Anastasius is my favourite nephew, and I know he will make sweet Ioannina very happy. It’s an auspicious thing to see families - until now linked so closely by the bonds of friendship, patriotism and loyalty – finally linked by the bond of holy marriage.\\n\\nNo doubt your wife has explained the unusual nature of their relationship at present and my role in facilitating it. It is indeed not ideal for them to be living together in carnal union before the ceremony itself, but it seemed unavoidable considering the love of the couple and the frequent postponements your wife insisted on. I know she is furious at her daughter’s lost ‘virtue’, but in my mind, the timing of the consummation is secondary to the pure intent to marry, and surely god, who sees all motives, will see this above all else. Perhaps she forgets, Belisarius, that her own virtue was hardly intact when the two of you entered your blessed union. Restrain her from rash action, bless this union, and this unpleasant situation can only be turned to good.	true

dilemmas_localised_description_att_bel_request_antoninia_rumours_1	Husband, what a fuss there was yesterday! However, I’m sure you just needed some time to calm down before you could clearly see the truth. I don’t want your apologies, but you will feel very silly once you hear what actually happened.\\n\\nTheo and I were burying treasure in the basement! You worked so hard in Carthage winning all that plunder and now Justinian just expects you to hand it over when all he did was sit on his throne looking pompous. I was hiding a few nice bits and pieces from the taxmen so you can keep the reward you really deserve. It was only afterwards that we realised how compromising it all looked! How silly! Anyway, once you’ve calmed down I’ll send you the money and we can forget all about it.	true

dilemmas_localised_description_ollam_ri_A2	Horn was correct! The old man hands the gleaming salmon over, but before the Ri can take a bite he is startled by the sight of a man perched in the branches of a tree. He claims he is Buile Shuibhne, a king cursed to live a half-avian life and driven to leap from tree to tree at the slightest noise. 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_ollam_ri_A3	Savouring his stolen salmon, the Ri wanders further down the bank. There he catches sight of a mysterious young woman tending to her horses. The Ri is in two minds. On the one hand, she might be a kelpie tending her malicious offspring. On the other, she might be a friendly young farmer.  	true
dilemmas_localised_description_ollam_ri_A1	The old man shakes his head firmly – a druid was not the answer.

dilemmas_localised_description_att_eos_religious_event_rebellion_att_fact_axum_att_rel_semitic_paganism	Long have we tolerated your adherence to this foreign and unholy religion. At the beginning of your reign you assured us that we would be allowed to flourish unthreatened by your beliefs, but it is clear to us now that these were empty words and that your true goal is the eradication of our faith and all who believe in it. It is too late for us to try to turn back the tide, but we demand the means to protect ourselves. Provide us with a gift of gold so that we may live according to our conscience and without fear of hardship. I make this request humbly, but know this: my followers are desperate men, and I fear blood will be spilled should they be denied. Choose more wisely than you have done thus far, my lord.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_att_eos_sassanid_insult_1	The Sassanid king, your overlord, has invited you to dine in the majestic summer palace he had you build just outside of Hira. His tongue loosened by the wine, the Shahanshah launches into an unprovoked attack on the character of your people:\\n"I see no good in the Arabs – materially and spiritually – they have no force or power in them, their place is with the beasts! They are deprived of the good things life offers: good food, drink and dress. Their food is camel meat, which even the lions refuse to eat because of its bad taste. How do you abide the kingship of these worthless people?"	true
dilemmas_localised_description_att_eos_sassanid_insult_2	The Shahanshah rolls his eyes exaggeratedly and staggers to his feet.\\n"If only my subject was as full of wisdom as he is pride! If you Arabs feed a guest they count it as a virtue, and of this their poets sing – they are lowly, poor and miserable and yet they are so proud and arrogant. They do not complain of hunger, poverty and misery and put themselves above all other nations – so of what are you so proud?"	true
dilemmas_localised_description_att_eos_sassanid_insult_3	Far from placating the Shahanshah, your agreement seems only to have fuelled his mockery.\\n"Where is the pride for which the Arabs are so famous? Surely you have a word to say in defence of your people, or a rebuke concerning the dissolution in which you perceive me to possess? Perhaps now that you have tasted the ways by which my people live, you have lost your fondness for the meanness and denial of your previous existence. It has pleased me to have a people so spirited under my command, but it would please me yet more to break their spirit. Say now that you prefer the traditions of the Sassanids over those of your own people and I will look upon you with great favour."	true

dilemmas_localised_description_att_bel_request_theodosia_pope_1	Belisarius, by all accounts you are among the blessed cohort of men whose earthly deeds are exceeded only by the many services they render to our Lord. Men who, like you, esteem the next life over their present situation always rejoice to hear of new opportunities with which to build the Kingdom of Heaven on this broken earth.\\n\\nRejoice then Belisarius, at the charge I bring you today. The Pope installed by the Goths, Silverus, is corrupt in both spirit and mind. Letters supporting the Ostrogothic rebels have been found in his possession and, while rumours circulate regarding their legitimacy, there is no doubt in my mind of their veracity. Many times have I tried to bring him into communion with the clergy in Constantinople but have found him to be willfully divisive. As Pope he will lead thousands into the damnation of heresy - a sin which outweighs any temporal trespass!\\n\\nThe Emperor talks of delicacy and reconciliation and will not act, but I know in his heart he longs for someone to take care of this problem for him – will you be his Holy warrior?	true

dilemmas_localised_description_cha_dilemma_carloman_succession	The tension all around the realm is palpable; it is time for you to decide your course of action in the matter of Carloman’s succession. This moment could be remembered for all time as the one in which the fate of all the Franks was decided. If you truly believe you are the rightful claimant to all of Carloman’s lands, then now is the time to strike. It will require military action to put down those loyal to him, but given the fractured state of affairs in his lands it may deal a decisive blow and end any conflict swiftly. However, should you choose to support Carloman’s son as the claimant to his lands, then a long-lasting, positive relationship could be built between your peoples; perhaps two Frankish kingdoms, firmly united, are as good as one? Make your choice, Charlemagne, your future awaits!	true

Your discovery of her with a local boy has sparked outrage; her name is on everybody’s lips, and your reputation is at stake. You can silence these murmurings in one of two ways – by reprimanding her, or by reprimanding the rumour-mongers.	true

Word of your continuing success resounds in my ears day and night – it would seem that you are driving the Ostrogoths from Italy with your own two arms, the way they talk! I must confess I find myself frustrated with the focus on personal works of valour rather than reconquest… But no matter, while it progresses, I am happy regardless.\\n\\nIndeed, in order to speed our undertaking and lift this unnaturally heavy burden from your shoulders I have dispatched Narses to help you. He is tactically astute and, best of all, loyal. He seeks no personal glory and can be trusted implicitly. Please do not see his appointment as a slight – after your recent successes there is no question of that – but instead as a reward. He will be most useful; I insist that you test his mettle for yourself in the heat of battle.	true
