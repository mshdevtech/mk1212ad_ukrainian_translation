prologue_chapters_description_1	The High Middle Ages have so far been a period of growth and prosperity, though not without its share of bloodshed. The era has been dominated by the Crusades, and two are ongoing at present: the Albigensian Crusade in southern France, and the Crusade against the Almohad Caliphate in the Iberian peninsula.\\n\\nAnother crusade with far-reaching effects was the Fourth Crusade, where the Byzantine Empire was overthrown and the Latin Empire established in its stead. Now, various Byzantine successor states and the Latins vie for control over the ashes of the Byzantine Empire.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Holy Land which has been continuously fought over for over a century is once more the target of a crusade. Pope Innocent III plans the conquest of Cairo from the Ayyubid Sultanate, hoping to re-take Jerusalem if Egypt can be secured. \\n\\nYet, all this may as well be insignificant in face of the horror approaching from the eastern steppes...	true
prologue_chapters_description_2	The current century has so far been calamitous, with multiple plagues and famines ravaging Europe. The climate has also cooled considerably, with brutal winters and cold, rainy summers compounding the effects of the famines. The last century had not only seen the climate situation chance, but also the political one.\\n\\nMany empires have fallen in the last century, such as the Ayyubids to the Mamluks and the Empire of the Latins to the Byzantines, who have reclaimed Constantinople. In Iberia, the Moors have been all but evicted from the peninsula, and Catholic Spanish kingdoms now dominate. Although victorious over the Muslims in the west, the inverse is true for the Catholics in the east, as the Mamluks have permanently expelled the crusaders from the Holy Land. The most jarring change has been in Central Asia, where the fractured remnants of the Mongol Empire now control vast swaths of territories over the ashes of their enemies.\\n\\nAlthough the medieval world has so far survived great invasions, famines, and plagues, a greater trial looms far to the east, soon to make its way west.	true
