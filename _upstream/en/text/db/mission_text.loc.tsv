mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_sand_1_2_description	Several Arabian and African tribal confederations formed into kingdoms, such as Himyar and Aksum. These dynastic nations, wealthy and powerful from the trade that passed through them, centralised power around a ruling class of kings with absolute authority.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_sand_2_2_description	For all the bluster and desires of would-be empires, very few nations can stand without aid, especially in the perilous and treacherous deserts. Alliances do not need to be permanent, but they need to be strong whilst it remains expedient.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_sand_1_1_description	War was one of the few constants in the shifting sands of the Arabian Peninsula. Tribes fought each other and together against Persian and Roman incursions. Those without the means to fight soon found themselves consumed.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_sand_2_1_description	A religious revolution took place throughout the Arabian peninsula during late antiquity. The mass abandonment of polytheism in favour of monotheistic Christianity and Judaism gripped the region, and drew new cultural and military lines in the sand.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_sand_3_1_description	The desert kingdoms fought to defend their way of life, and later to proselytise their religions to others. Religion was used as just another tool for the subjugation of other, weaker peoples.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_sand_4_1_description	To the south of the Arabian Peninsula lies the Indian Ocean, and beyond it the Far East. Trade prospects made any who travelled the waters fabulously wealthy, so control of the oceans was widely coveted.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_sand_5_1_description	Many of the desert kingdoms came into contact, through war or alliance, with the mighty Roman and Sassanid Empires. Some of their methods of fighting were thus influenced by the more rigorous training and drill of the Imperial powers.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_cordoba_1_1_description	Abd al-Rahman, a member of the deposed Umayyad royalty, reconquered Iberian Peninsula, uniting fractured groups of Arabs and Berbers. Although he managed to kill the old Emir, Al-Fihri, it would be many years before he subdued all supporters of the previous regime. Toledo, the old Visigothic capital, remained a hotbed of dissonance and a pressing priority for the new Emir.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_cordoba_2_1_description	Abd al-Rahman’s first few decades in power were marked by a constant struggle to re-unite the old Umayyad territories of the Peninsula. Valencia proved so unwilling to submit that he ordered it destroyed in AD755, only to change his mind and pass it down to his son.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_cordoba_3_1_description	Zaragoza’s resistance nearly proved disastrous for the Emirate of Cordoba. In desperation, the city turned to the Frankish king Charlemagne, inviting him down to the Iberian Peninsula. Fortunately - for the Emirate at least – the citizens of Zaragoza changed their minds and decided Abd al-Rahman would be the better master after all.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_cordoba_4_1_description	As one of the northernmost Islamic territories, Barcelona maintained a significant degree of autonomy. As such, it was one of the first cities to submit to Charlemagne’s son Louis. By stamping his authority more severely, perhaps Abd al-Rahman could have avoided this setback.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_cordoba_5_1_description	The Kingdom of Asturias was the only Christian state in the heart of the Iberian Peninsula. Protected by the Cantabrian Mountains, its stubborn citizens launched repeated raids and would later play a large part in the Reconquista.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_cordoba_1_3_description	The new Emir continued the strong Umayyad tradition of religious patronage. Most famously, he started work on the Great Mosque of Cordoba, buying a Christian church and converting it to a place of worship designed to eclipse those found elsewhere in the Islamic world. 	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_cordoba_2_3_description	The new Emir continued the strong Umayyad tradition of religious patronage.

mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_cordoba_1_2_description	Abd al-Rahman’s success was based in large part upon his personal military reputation. In one battle, finding his army without a standard, he wrapped a turban around a spear and used it as a makeshift flag. On another occasion, he swapped his Spanish stallion for a mule to silence suggestions he might flee from the battle.	true

mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_lombards_1_1_description	The Lombards spent the centuries before Charlemagne’s rise consolidating and expanding the territory claimed following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. Central to this was their struggle to absorb the lands of the Exarchate of Ravenna – the last bastion of Byzantine authority in Italy. In AD751, King Aistulf conquered Ravenna, leaving only Venice in Roman hands. 	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_lombards_2_1_description	One of the challenges facing any Lombard monarch was securing the loyalty and obedience of the many dukes in his domain. The powerful duchies of Benevento and Spoileto had a track record of dissent, having transferred their allegiance to the Frankish king, Charlemagne’s father Pepin, before being brutally bought to heel.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_lombards_3_1_description	A long term animosity existed between the Papal States and the Lombard Kingdom. While the Exarch existed, there was an uneasy balance between the three Italian powers, but in its absence there was little to stop the Lombards invading Papal territories. Indeed, as soon as Pope Adrian sided with Charlemagne against Carloman’s wife, King Desiderius did just that.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_lombards_4_1_description	The Lombard invasion of northern Italy finally brought an end to the long tradition of a single power in control of the entire Italian Peninsula. In the decades of proceeding turmoil, only the Lombards ever looked likely to restore unified rule to the region, though their aspirations were abruptly ended by Frankish intervention.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_lombards_5_1_description	The destinies of the Franks and Lombards had been entwined for some time. Over time, they overcame internal opposition and fragmentation to emerge as the two most powerful central European empires, making conflict inevitable. By casting off his Lombard bride and siding with the Pope, Charlemagne ignited the struggle that would see him eventually claim the Iron Crown of Lombardy for himself.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_lombards_1_2_description	The Lombards combined influences from several different military traditions to forge their own way of war. The methods of their Germanic  ancestors, which enabled their initial conquests, combined with the late Roman model, found in their conquered lands, along with something new, brought about by advances in the military technology of the period.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_1_5_description	The Visigoths lost much of their northern territory as the Franks expanded relentlessly through Gaul. By AD508 they had been almost entirely relegated to Hispania. Nobody likes to have their rightful territory taken from them.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_2_5_description	The Franks were able to successfully conquer Visigothic Gaul only with Burgundian assistance. Therefore, in Visigothic eyes, they were just as guilty as the Franks, and could expect an equal share of the revenge to come.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_3_5_description	The Ostrogoths were a powerful force to capture the Italian heartland, but were pressured to the point of defeat by Belisarius' expedition. Better maintenance of their relationship with the Visigoths, their kin, may have enabled them to stave off the Romans indefinitely.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_4_5_description	Justinian's Empire was one of re-expansion by any method, even resorting to underhand dealings to achieve his aims. If left to his own devices, and allowed peace, he may have manipulated all of Europe back into Rome's grasp.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_5_5_description	Theoderic the Great once ruled over both branches of Goths, with the Visigoths subservient to his own Ostrogothic Kingdom. Had the Visigoths grown into a great empire, their positions may have been reversed.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_1_4_description	The Visigoths and Ostrogoths were once a united people, and the former were subsequently ruled by Theoderic, the Ostrogothic king, between AD511 and AD526. The common heritage and values they shared would have served them well had they allied against Belisarius.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_2_4_description	Before the Franks' expansion, southern Gaul belonged to the Visigoths. Though the Franks demonstrated great power by their actions, their aggression could not be ignored. The Visigoths needed to show strength, and reclaim their territory.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_3_4_description	Europe was explosive; in constant flux. As wars raged, Africa appeared much more stable. Like the Vandals before them, the Visigoths would have been wise to gain a foothold on the continent, by force if necessary.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_4_4_description	In AD549, a rebellion in Hispania was the excuse used by Justinian to send in his army and regain a foothold in the region for Rome. For the Visigoths, keeping rebellions down was the key to keeping the Romans out.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_5_4_description	The rise of the Visigoths in Hispania was one the Vandals' chief reasons for pushing further along the African coast and establishing themselves in Carthage. If the Visigothic Kingdom needed to expand, where better than to follow the Vandals into Africa?	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_1_1_description	The history of the barbarian kingdoms is marked by the advent of more sophisticated, proto-Medieval hierarchies. Yet the old ways died hard, and dynastic disputes plagued the new realms. However, there was always one simple solution for dealing with would-be usurpers...	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_2_1_description	The Migration Period saw many barbarian groups displaced by the Huns, so they settled and formed kingdoms far from their homelands. This new-found strength could not last forever, not alone - allies were needed if they were to maintain their hold on their new homes.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_3_1_description	Inheriting former Imperial infrastructures meant that the barbarian kingdoms ruled over predominantly non-native populations. As a result, the native nobility tried to promote their legitimacy whenever possible.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_4_1_description	Although abandoning much of their tribal roots, the new barbarian kingdoms nevertheless placed a premium on individual strength, and personal power still paved the road to greatness.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_5_1_description	In the recent past, most barbarian income came from raids on the lucrative cities of the Empire. Whilst this continued - their raids making them fabulously wealthy - they also adapted the efficient Roman infrastructure to their own needs, which enabled barbarian society to prosper.	true
mission_text_text_mis_activity_raid_region	Raid any settlement or trade route.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_1_3_description	The Visigoths travelled the length and breadth of Europe before settling in Hispania and establishing a vast kingdom. At their backs, however, were the Suebi, a historically belligerent people who could pose a danger if not subdued.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_2_3_description	Constant warfare caused dissent amongst the Visigothic population, so much so that Alaric was forced to put down rebellions following the Frankish invasion. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_3_3_description	The Franks became the inheritors of the Western Empire, with Charlemagne at the head. At one time, however, the Visigoths were perfectly placed to stop their meteoric rise.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_4_3_description	Imperial Rome, though much reduced after the collapse of the Western Empire, was ever making inroads to reconquer its lost lands. Hispania was one of its targets, but the Visigoths would not relinquish their new home without a struggle.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_5_3_description	The Visigoths believed that Rome's attempts to recapture its lost territory were futile. Believing their own kingdom equal in stature, they returned Roman attacks in kind, with raids of their own; by pillage and destruction, they would show the Empire that its time was over.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_1_2_description	Strength and tenacity had allowed the barbarian kingdoms to arise from the ashes of the crumbling Roman Empire, yet a softness developed amongst the tribes after they settled. Their once-fierce warriors would need training if they were to win wars for their new kings.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_2_2_description	Old habits die hard. Though settled and almost civilised, the barbarians still fed on Rome's weaknesses, raiding its lands whenever the opportunity arose.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_3_2_description	A clash of religious ideals occurred when the barbarians encountered the predominant 'Chalcedonian' form of Christianity, which the Western Empire had already propagated within its provinces. To the new kings, this just would not do…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_4_2_description	The barbarian kingdoms were inheritors of some of the wealthiest of Roman lands, including some with silver and jewel deposits. Combined with their legacy of exquisitely crafted jewellery, the resulting products truly were wonders to behold.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_visigothi_5_2_description	In barbarian tradition, the strongest was usually the leader; hereditary succession was not considered if the ancestor held no power. Yet when inhabiting the infrastructures of the former Roman Empire, this became a consideration, in many cases for the first time.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_huns_1_1_description	Towards the end of the 4th century AD, the Huns escalated the frequency of their raids into Eastern Roman-controlled territories.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_huns_2_1_description	Despite their warlike nature and history of conflict with the Romans, groups of independent Huns - eager for combat and spoils - often joined them in battle against other barbarians.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_huns_3_1_description	At the start of the 5th century AD, a number of barbarian confederation began migrating westward, driven by the Hunnic horde's superior strength and numbers.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_huns_4_1_description	Before Attila, Rugila struck fear into the hearts of the Eastern Romans during his campaigns in Thrace. Although their capital was spared, the Romans had to pay an extortionate sum of gold in tribute to prevent further attacks.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_huns_5_1_description	Compared with the East, the Huns maintained relatively civil relations with the Western Roman Empire for quite some time. However, this period of grace came to an abrupt end when a bizarre diplomatic failure led Attila to believe that he was to marry the Emperor's sister, and receive the entire Western Empire as a wedding gift!	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_huns_1_3_description	Despite their warlike nature and history of conflict with the Romans, groups of independent Huns - eager for combat and spoils - often joined them in battle against other barbarians.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_huns_4_3_description	There is some evidence to suggest that Attila murdered his brother, Bleda, in order to secure control of the horde, and that he himself was later assassinated by jaded subjects following his defeat at Roman hands.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_huns_5_3_description	The Huns extorted much from the Eastern Roman Empire over the years, so they exploited Attila's war with the West to claw something back. Furious, Attila had already begun marching against the East when he died, causing the invasion to grind to a halt.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_huns_1_2_description	Following their raiding of the Caucasus and Asia Minor, a Hunnic warband drove into the heart of the Sassanid Empire, sacking the great cities of the east as they went.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_huns_2_2_description	The Huns were thwarted in their attempts to invade the Sassanid Empire, but nevertheless they came dangerously close to capturing Ctesiphon, the Sassanid capital.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_huns_3_2_description	Initially a disparate confederation of self-governing hosts, Attila's rise to power saw the unification of the Hunnic hordes under a single monarch.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_huns_4_2_description	Although advances in siegecraft meant little during field battles on the steppes, the Huns quickly realised how to break into the walled cities of the civilised world.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_huns_5_2_description	Attila's campaign against the West led his forces into Gaul, where the epic Battle of the Catalaunian Plains put an end to his relentless rampage westwards.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_1_1_description	The Caledonians long held their border against Rome, but as the Empire fractured, the opportunity to become stronger than the invaders presented itself. With Hadrian's Wall unmanned it was only a matter of time…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_2_1_description	Raiding was the Celtic way of life, both as a means of survival and of warfare - destruction and looting devastated enemies whilst enriching and emboldening the raiders. Entire genres of literature about raiding exemplifies its importance.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_3_1_description	AD410 marked the approximate end of Roman rule in Britain, although their forces in the north had been removed over twenty years previous. In this void, the Celts were presented with an opportunity to re-assert their rule over a weak and vulnerable island.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_4_1_description	Rome, once the 'eternal city', remained as testament to how far its Empire had fallen. Abandoned by both men and gods, it could be home for the Caledonian people, and their Caledonian gods.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_5_1_description	An empire cannot be built on tribal foundations. The infrastructure, bureaucracy and, most importantly, money, keeps it growing and expanding.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_1_2_description	The Kingdom of Dál Riata was a kingdom of Irish and Scottish Celtic tribes that banded together in the middle of the 1st century AD. Although eventually checked at the Battle of Degsastan, it could have been powerful and endured much longer - if it had been controlled by the right tribes of course.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_2_2_description	The Caledonians were a hybrid group of Picts and fleeing southern peoples. North of them lay the 'pure' Picts, known for their ferocity and determination. If the Caledonians were to survive, the Picts could not be trusted, or endured indefinitely.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_3_2_description	Celtic military forces were structured according to social class. The elites were led by the 'Uiros Ueramos' - the 'highest man', a war leader. His immediate cohorts were known as 'ambaxtoi' - 'those who accompany'. The main body of Celtic infantry and cavalry followed below these elites.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_4_2_description	In Gaelic society, the strength of single men often determined the fate of entire tribes. The strongest would become chieftain and, during war, battles could be decided by single combat between two champions.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_5_2_description	When barbarians or Huns raided Eastern Roman territory, the Imperials retreated behind the walls of Constantinople and waited until the marauders departed. The settlements outside of the city, therefore, were often left vulnerable and isolated.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_1_3_description	The split in the Roman Empire in AD395 left the West considerably weaker than the East. With Hadrian's Wall undefended, the wealthy Roman city of Eboracum lay vulnerable to would-be attackers.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_2_3_description	Eventually, the spread of Christianity through the western world reached the Celtic tribes. Yet there were some who fought fiercely to maintain the old ways, and keep their old gods…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_3_3_description	The lifestyle of the Celts lent itself to subsistence and raiding - surviving on what they could. Yet when inhabiting the cities of departed civilisations, a certain administrative framework was inherited.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_caledonians_5_3_description	In AD532, the Nika Riots destroyed much of Constantinople and reminded the Emperor that, although more powerful than ailing Rome, the Eastern Romans were not untouchable.

mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_1_4_description	The world in the 5th century was subject to terrible upheaval. Huns rampaged, migrating barbarians marauded in fear, and the Romans – though pressured - were ever desirous of others’. For anyone who did not maintain a strong enough army, desolation seemed inevitable.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_2_4_description	Perun, the lord of the Slavic ‘quintheism’, and thunder god, was said to protect those who worshipped him. His followers carved circular symbols, known as ‘gromoviti znaci’, into their houses to invoke his divine protection from storms.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_3_4_description	The Venedians were the original Slavs, and because they became so populous the Anteans and Sclavenians broke away from them. This massive population explosion meant that new settlements were required to house the seemingly endless flow of people.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_4_4_description	The Slavs were true to their gods, having known nothing but the protection and wisdom of the quintheism. As they expanded, they were sure to proselytise their religion among those they conquered. Under the watchful gaze of Perun, the Slavs knew that they would prosper.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_5_4_description	Inheriting the mantle of civilisation is no easy task, but it is one that the Slavs readily aspired to. Had they achieved their dreams of empire, they could have endeavoured to create a civilisation worthy of the ancients.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_1_1_description	The Slavs emerged with a fierce determination to forge an identity and protect themselves amidst a world in chaos. Their martial skill was impressive – they fought any would-be conqueror, even rebuking the Huns on several occasions.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_2_1_description	The Slavs inherited the northeast of Europe and, through solid grit and determination, maintained their control. Threats from all around challenged them – the Huns, migrating barbarians, and of course the Romans, but through strength and great resolve, the Slavs endured.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_3_1_description	The Slavs knew the land, and how to harness its secrets better than anyone else. Yet the changing climate of the 5th century threatened their agricultural superiority, and so it was important that they prepared for the coming cold.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_4_1_description	The Slavs were constantly under threat. The Huns and barbarians pushed from the east, Rome from the south, and to the west the Germanic tribes tried to push back. Yet the Slavs were resolute, and fiercely determined.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_5_1_description	The Slavs saw the borders of nations as nothing more than arbitrary checks to their power. Beyond these borders was land more deserving of a Slavic empire. The determined, proud people of the tribes knew that their destiny lay beyond their meagre homes.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_1_2_description	The Slavic tribes were masters of the land, able to create thriving agricultural economies in areas where other peoples would assuredly fail. They were therefore able to survive, endure and prosper, even as other tribes around them were swept away.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_2_2_description	By Roman reckoning, the Slavs were barbarians by nature, but in fact many of them aspired to a more ‘civilised’ society. Also like the Romans, Slavs dreamed of empire and security, and of minor nations that would be servile to their whim.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_3_2_description	Martial prowess was the only way survival was assured in late antiquity, and even then it wasn’t always successful. With the world shifting beneath the feet of nations, only strength of arms stood a chance at halting the tide of anarchy and re-establishing order.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_4_2_description	Proximity to the greater powers of the world meant that the Slavs needed to show themselves to be powerful and wealthy, lest the Roman Empire or others thought them an easy target for absorption. Money begets power, so money was required.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_5_2_description	As the Slav’s influence grew and grew, and their power increased, it became ever more important that their military might grew to accommodate it. More and more, men were expected to fight for their tribes, which they did in great numbers.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_1_3_description	The Slavs worshipped a pagan pantheon of gods, centred around what they called ‘quintheism’ – a group of five gods that controlled the sky, the air, the sun, the earth and the underworld. Lord of them all was Perun, the thunder god, and head of the pantheon.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_2_3_description	Transient and ever-moving, the Slavs had little time for their own mining endeavours. It was much easier, as nimble and powerful warriors, to raid deep into enemy territory and take what they needed instead.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_3_3_description	The Slavs were a dominant culture, able to exercise their will over people who crossed them. On more than one occasion, the Slavs assimilated other tribes and nationalities, making them part of their ever-expanding culture.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_4_3_description	Strength of arms was not a guarantee of survival in late antiquity, but it stood tribes in better stead than if they were unarmed. At least with a sword in hand, a man could face the coming chaos with a fighting chance, and a cry of war.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_slav_5_3_description	Empires are built on the back of military victories, and the Slavs were no strangers to that. Their men were strong, and ferocious, and focused on victory in the name of their people. Yet more victory was required if they were to build themselves into a power like no other!	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_1_2_description	Even though the Vandals had successfully conquered Africa, their rule was not accepted as legitimate by the population. Continued persecution of their enemies and heavy-handedness with the locals undermined Vandal authority, leading to revolts across the land.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_2_2_description	The Vandals' relations with the Ostrogoths were strained after they imprisoned the Ostrogothic widow of their late king, Amalafrida. Yet with the Romans advancing, circumstance demanded they mend their broken relationship for the sake of survival.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_3_2_description	Historically, when defeated by Belisarius, the Vandals retreated into Berber lands, where many simply integrated into African society. Yet if the Vandal kingdom had survived, the Berbers would have had to be dealt with one way or another.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_4_2_description	The Vandals' migration that resulted in their conquest of Africa took them through Gaul and Hispania, where they survived for a while. Had their kingdom survived Belisarius' attack, they may eventually have chosen to revisit their affluent former home.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_5_2_description	The Vandals were successful in Africa, but they might have yearned to one day return to their European homeland. Had they the strength and security, they may have planned a return trip…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_1_3_description	Before Belisarius' expedition, the Vandals had repelled several Roman attempts to reconquer Africa. At the Battle of Cap Bon in AD468, their bold shock tactics crushed the Imperial army. When perfectly executed, this Vandal strategy was terrifyingly effective.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_2_3_description	Belisarius' aim was to advance on Gelimer quickly and take Carthage in short order. This was because a protracted conflict was unsustainable for his army, and Justinian was ever impatient…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_3_3_description	When seizing Africa from the Romans, the Vandals inherited one of the most affluent parts of Imperial territory. Utilising the land's potential made it a powerful kingdom indeed.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_4_3_description	The Franks, who remained in Gaul, developed into a powerful kingdom once the Vandals migrated away from them. If it had survived, the Vandal Kingdom may have had to face the Franks in battle in order to check their expansion.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_5_3_description	The Mediterranean Sea was the key to the wealth of ancient Europe and Africa. Control of it gave control of its trade routes, which made the Vandal Kingdom fabulously wealthy.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_1_1_description	The Roman Empire's arrogance and foolishness caused them to lose Carthage to the Vandals, rather than divine providence. From the Vandals point of view, their enduring spirit delivered to them a promised land - no general, and no expeditionary force, would take back their home.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_2_1_description	Plagued as he was by political turmoil, Gelimer was still able to conduct espionage against the Imperial army. He sent agents to undermine them and foster dissent amongst Rome's unhappy Hunnic foederati.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_3_1_description	It was the fragility of human relationships that had caused the breakdown of Vandal relations with the Ostrogoths many years before. Yet a common enemy is a galvanising factor, and Belisarius' determined advance was certainly cause for unity.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_4_1_description	As they moved away from their migratory, barbarian past, the Vandals commissioned grand building projects and education initiatives, fostering some of late antiquity's greatest minds in the process.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_5_1_description	Belisarius' campaign was a risky venture. Had it failed, then the Vandals may have become sufficiently emboldened to strike again at the Imperial heartland.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_1_4_description	The Vandals made alliances whenever possible to cement themselves amongst their African neighbours. Gelimer was able to rally the Moors and Berbers to his cause when he required military support.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_2_4_description	As belief in the one true God spread across the ancient world, friction arose between its various denominations. The Vandals at first persecuted religious difference, but some subsequent kings were more tolerant. For stability to be maintained, the question of religion needed an answer.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_3_4_description	The Vandal fleet was known for its successes, famously destroying the Roman navy at the Battle of Cartagena, as well as raiding the Imperial coast throughout the 5th century AD.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_4_4_description	Although abandoning much of their tribal roots, the new barbarian kingdoms nevertheless placed a premium on individual strength, and personal power still paved the road to greatness.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_5_4_description	In the recent past, most barbarian income came from raids on the lucrative cities of the Empire. Whilst this continued - their raids making them fabulously wealthy - they also adapted the efficient Roman infrastructure to their own needs, which enabled barbarian society to prosper.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_1_5_description	Justinian's excuse for war with the Vandal Kingdom was its lack of effective, united leadership under Gelimer following the death of his pro-Roman predecessor. Gradually, dissent at home began to undermine and weaken the Vandal king's position.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_2_5_description	Old habits die hard. Though settled and almost civilised, the barbarians still fed on Rome's weaknesses, raiding its lands whenever the opportunity arose.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_3_5_description	Inheriting former Imperial infrastructures meant that the barbarian kingdoms ruled over predominantly non-native populations. As a result, the native nobility tried to promote their legitimacy whenever possible.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_4_5_description	The barbarian kingdoms were inheritors of some of the wealthiest of Roman lands, including some with silver and jewel deposits. Combined with their legacy of exquisitely crafted jewellery, the resulting products truly were wonders to behold.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_vandali_5_5_description	In barbarian tradition, the strongest was usually the leader; hereditary succession was not considered if the ancestor held no power. Yet when inhabiting the infrastructures of the former Roman Empire, this became a consideration, in many cases for the first time.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_1_1_description	The Burgundians travelled far from their frozen homes in Scandinavia,  seeking the warmth and fertility offered by the south. Although stiff competition from other tribes awaited them, Belz was an ideal place to begin their new lives.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_2_1_description	Although the Burgundians travelled south in search of a new life and a more arable climate, there were those who remained on their old homelands between the Oder and Vistula rivers, determined to defend their ancestral origins.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_3_1_description	Inevitably, even the most ancient and sentimental of homes must be abandoned in the face of unliveable conditions. The Great Migration, or 'Volkerwandergun', saw the Germanic tribes push beyond their frontiers into the Roman Empire.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_4_1_description	The Burgundians did not always raid and pillage Roman lands. They were also, at times, considered foederati, and allowed to settle around Maxima Sequanorum. The Burgundian capital was at Lugdunum.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_5_1_description	From their capital in Lugdunum, the Burgundians had their choice of avenues. They could have expanded further into Italy and conquered there, or spread further west, into Narbonensis and along the coast of the Mediterranean.	true
mission_text_text_mis_abort_owning_faction_made_peace	You are no longer at war with the target's faction.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_1_2_description	The spear, by now an essential weapon of war, began life as the hunter's tool. The Burgundians, weathered experts of the hunt from years in the cold north, were masterful in their use of this weapon.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_2_2_description	Although they vied for control of crucial parcels of land, the migratory tribes were not against co-operation when necessary. In AD411, the Burgundian king, Gunther, allied with the Alans in order to place a puppet Roman Emperor on the throne for their own gain.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_3_2_description	As the Burgundians pushed further into Western Roman territory, the clashes between them became more violent. As the Romans began to find these incursions intolerable, the Burgundians raided with greater intensity, burning and pillaging Imperial lands.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_4_2_description	With the Western Roman Empire in tatters, it fell to the remaining Germanic tribes to create their own kingdoms. An alliance between Franks and Burgundians resulted in the creation of a codex of Germanic law built upon a Latin framework, known as the Codex Burgundionum.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_5_2_description	The Burgundians were no strangers to alliance. Throughout their history, they allied with Alans, Franks and Romans in order to carve a place for themselves in the new world, and to survive the death of the old one.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_1_3_description	Before the descent of the Great Migrators, land in Europe was already scarce. With the tribes' arrival, space for settlers became increasingly contested, with all tribes prepared to fight for it.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_2_3_description	The rapidly freezing climate and loss of fertile farmland resulted in the development of food 'curing' techniques in order to preserve it. Salt, a key component in the process, became increasingly valuable to those wishing to preserve food, and thereby survive.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_3_3_description	The 'Nibelungenlied', an epic poem of Middle High German origin, speaks of the Burgundians clashing with Hunnic forces employed as mercenaries by the Western Roman Empire.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_4_3_description	The Franks conquered much of the Western Roman Empire's territory after it collapsed, establishing themselves as a powerful kingdom which gradually encroached upon and weakened the Burgundians. Yet it didn't have to be that way…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_burgundians_5_3_description	Maintaining power within a tribal confederation slowly forging itself into a kingdom is not easy. It is said that King Gundobad murdered his brother and exiled his daughter in the name of power. Sometimes, successful rule requires drastic action.	true
mission_text_text_generic_current_total_out_of_coop	Current combined total: %n / %n	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_axum_1_3_description	Aksumite expansion into an imperial power took them west into Kush and east, across the gulf, into southern Arabia. Smaller Arabian states were subsumed into its empire, whilst the larger nations had to be made to bend the knee to Aksumite ascension.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_axum_2_3_description	Aksum's power and position made it an influential player in the world trade economy. As Rome's primary link to the east, it enjoyed the good graces of the local empires - Rome and Sassanid Persia - whose constant disputes made good relations with the Aksumites vital.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_axum_3_3_description	Persian expansion under the Sassanid dynasty was dramatic and threatened both Rome and her allies. Its land grab even expanded as far as Yemen and so, as Aksum also had interests in the area, the Persians made themselves a target.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_axum_4_3_description	Aksum maintained power in the Gulf of Aden through its powerful navy. Though it never expanded north of Egypt into the Mediterranean, had it done so the powerful Aksumite navy would certainly have furthered the kingdom's interests to the north.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_axum_5_3_description	Aksum's culture reached several important milestones - it had its own alphabet - one the first eastern scripts to include vowels, and also created impressive tombs and funerary obelisks for the Aksumite kings.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_axum_1_2_description	Empires were never born from being pleasant to those around them. Aksum's intervention in south Arabian affairs is documented; warring often with the Arabian nations and regularly demanding payment from them in tribute.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_axum_2_2_description	The Kingdom of Himyar, which came to control what is now modern-day Yemen, was a threat to the economic and religious interests of the Aksumites, with equally good access to the Arabian sea. This made their defeat and subjugation a necessity.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_axum_3_2_description	At its apex, the Aksumite Empire spread across southern Egypt and Arabia, but never further than that. Another hop across the sea would have solidified its position on the Arabian Peninsula, and total power over the entire Red Sea region.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_axum_4_2_description	Over the course of Aksum's imperial tenure, its religion changed from polytheistic paganism to Christianity. Minted coins show the shift, from the pagan symbols to the cross and inscriptions in reverence of the Holy Trinity.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_axum_5_2_description	Aksum had the means to make itself into a mighty empire. Before its decline, it stood almost as tall as the Romans and Sassanids.

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_5_2_description	In barbarian tradition, the strongest was usually the leader; hereditary succession was not considered if the ancestor held no power.

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_3_3_description	Clovis wasn't especially hostile towards Rome, even pledging loyalty to the Emperor at one stage. However, the growth of the Frankish Kingdom and Clovis' expansionism saw that that loyalty soon discarded.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_4_3_description	The 'Lex Salica', commissioned by Clovis, was the first attempt to codify Frankish law, under the diligent supervision of four advisors.

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_5_3_description	The Langobards, descending from the north, soon began to undo hard-won Roman victories in Italy. To the Franks, who had interests in expanding into former Imperial territory, this must have been intolerable.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_2_1_description	The Migration Period saw many barbarian groups displaced by the Huns, so they settled and formed kingdoms far from their homelands.

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_5_1_description	In the recent past, most barbarian income came from raids on the lucrative cities of the Empire.

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_2_4_description	To the south of Gaul, the Visigoths had established a kingdom that had also begun to expand. The Franks pushed against them and, with battles such as Vouillé, secured their hold over Gaul, relegating the Visigoths to Hispania.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_3_4_description	Belisarius pressured the Ostrogoths so much so they called upon the Franks for aid. Moving swiftly across the Alps, with the Burgundians in tow, Imperial forces were pinned down in a hopeless siege at Mediolanum.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_4_4_description	To the Franks, allegiances were always considered temporary as, after their aid to the Ostrogoths against Rome, they again attacked - this time routing the Gothic army as well.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_5_4_description	The Franks went from a powerful Gallic kingdom to the true inheritors of the Roman Imperial legacy, with their leaders styled as 'Holy Roman' Emperors.

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_1_5_description	With the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Franks' chief threat was Theoderic the Great in Italy. Between the Franks and the Ostrogoths, however, lay the Burgundians. Past relationships, though erratic, were enough to forge an alliance.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_2_5_description	The birth of Frankish Catholicism also saw the advent of canonical law; the establishment of an ecclesiastical codex that led to the Church wielding both religious and political power for centuries to come.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_3_5_description	The Ostrogoths and the Franks had little love for one another, but in the face of the Roman invasion of Italy, and its growing chances of victory, an alliance with old foes may have appeared prudent to both sides.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_franks_4_5_description	The Frankish attack over the Alps was the precursor to a full Italian invasion, yet their powerful army was struck down by dysentery, resulting in a total failure to press its advantage.

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_1_2_description	The link between religion and war has always been strong among the Langobards. The legend of their origins saw Godan grant them victory in battle upon seeing them first, asking "who are those long beards?" 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_2_2_description	The club, for 'civilised' nations, was the tool of law, not the military. The tribes, however, embraced it as a powerful weapon that, when  adapted properly, could fell even the most powerful mounted clibinarii.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_3_2_description	After abandoning their homes further north, the Langobards set their sights on Italy. Like many migrating tribes, the warmth and prosperity of the Mediterranean drove them south. The Langobards tried to claim the Italian Peninsula, and the wealth and security it offered. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_4_2_description	The wolf warriors of the Langobards are said to have been incensed by 'Godan's dance'. The possible reality of this is that tribal elders, channelling their god, performed the dance and instructed the youths who became the "young wolves".	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_5_2_description	As the Langobards travelled further south, they increasingly came into contact with Christianity. When in Pannonia, they were exposed to Christian doctrine but not converted by it. By AD500, however, they had been largely converted to Catholicism.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_1_3_description	By the middle of the 3rd century AD, the Roman Empire acknowledged the legitimacy of the Frankish Kingdom. With their strength solidified, other tribes saw the wisdom in acquainting themselves with the rising Franks.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_2_3_description	The Langobards took an unusually progressive approach to slavery, following their own belief that it was preferable to die free than live in servitude to another. As a result, enemy prisoners were incorporated into the Langobard army as free men.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_3_3_description	It was Caesar who first recorded the daring barbarian tactic of 'horse stabbing', but it endured long into late antiquity. Brave Germanic warriors, proceeding against mounted foes, would dive beneath and stab the enemy's steeds. The tactic was so effective it often led to total victory.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_4_3_description	The danger of tribal hierarchy was that every king had a say, and had men loyal to him and only him. A tribal confederation could collapse and fragment as easily as it was unified. Ultimately only singular rule, by one man, could create the desired unity of purpose.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_5_3_description	The later Lombard Kingdom was remarkable for the tranquillity which settled over it from the end of the 5th century AD onwards. An alliance with the Bavarii led to civility with the Eastern Romans and, from that, stability for the Lombards.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_1_1_description	The Langobards were people of Godan - the god who, in legend, gave the tribe its name. Langobard wolf warriors were inspired by Godan's 'dance', and incensed to fight with fierce passion.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_2_1_description	The Gepids went on to become enemies of the Langobards, and their king, Audoin, subjugated them as the tribe moved deeper into western Europe and solidified itself. The land is there, and worth taking...	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_3_1_description	The Great Migrators never stayed in one place for too long. The cold continued its unrelenting descent from the north, and so the Langobards were forced to move on. Italy was close, and warmth awaited…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_4_1_description	As the Langobards grew out of their tribal trappings, forging themselves slowly into a kingdom, the Italian Peninsula and all it contained became their targets. In the 5th century AD they breached Italian borders and began creating a new life for themselves.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_langobards_5_1_description	After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Italian Peninsula was ripe for the picking. The Langobards occupied the area under Alboin, capturing Roman cities and establishing the Lombard Duchy, laying the groundwork for the future Lombard Kingdom.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_1_1_description	The Western Roman Empire was ailing. With too many fronts and not enough men, they made peace wherever they could. With an undefended border, the Picts could exact tribute, lest the Romans risk a war they could not win.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_2_1_description	The Picts were a frightening sight on the battlefield. Painted, tattooed and carrying weapons of unconventional colour to Roman eyes, the mere rumour of their barbarity put fear into Roman hearts.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_3_1_description	The undefended wealth of the Roman Empire was there for the taking, and any wise barbarian king would surely reach out to seize it. Making sure not to squander it, however, was the next challenge…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_4_1_description	Celtic leaders became leaders because they were strong, and remained so because they maintained that strength. Political support came from being both powerful and even-handed. Those kings who were pure warriors died from more than just their wounds on the battlefield…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_5_1_description	The menace of the Huns did much to assist the slow death of the Roman Empire, and their ceaseless marauding was a menace to every nation and empire in late antiquity. Their early defeat would have brought a degree of stability to an otherwise increasingly chaotic world.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_1_2_description	Between the Picts and Romans lived the Caledonians. Roman wealth could only go to the mightiest - necessity, therefore, dictated that the Caledonians be defeated so that the Picts may rise.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_2_2_description	By the 5th century AD, the Western Roman Empire was beginning to collapse. Unable to defend its vast holdings, its frontiers crumbled. Londinium was a centre of Roman power in Britain. If lost, so to were Rome's Britannic dreams.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_3_2_description	Rome had long been considered too unsafe to remain the Western Roman capital, and so it moved several times towards the end of the Empire's life. Mediolanium sat at the foot of the Alps and, thrust into Gaul, was arguably a more vulnerable capital than Rome.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_4_2_description	Though it fought to the last, the Western Roman Empire lost much of its strength and prosperity, most of which was held by its Eastern counterpart. To claim wealth and glory, the true inheritor of Roman power would need to face the Emperor in Constantinople.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_5_2_description	As antiquity passed into the Dark Ages, tribal raiding nations faded. The migrating peoples either settled into civilised kingdoms or were destroyed. Empires spread, and those in the way were simply subsumed. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_1_3_description	The Eildon Hills marked one of the wealthiest areas of the Highlands. Owned by the Picts but coveted by the Romans, control of the settlement would confer wealth, and a strong highland position.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_2_3_description	Eboracum was the largest Roman city in northern Britannia, and the Empire invested much into its development and maintenance. A hub for traders and entrepreneurs, the city's loss would represent a devastating blow to Roman interests in the region.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_3_3_description	The Viking raids along the east coast of Britannia increased after their first raid, and became the prelude to colonisation. A Pict-controlled island would not suffer to let the Danelaw become reality.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_4_3_description	The Picts were a fearfully fierce people, being both savage and indiscriminate on the battlefield. Those who faced them spoke of their ferocity, and the terrifying images of their tattooed faces and painted bodies. Their victims, on the other hand, said nothing. Ever again.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_picts_5_3_description	The Picts may have spread to every corner of the Earth, but at heart they would always have been a warmongering nation with tribal roots. Wherever they went, they would always have found someone to fight against.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_white_huns_1_2_description	Inevitably, White Hun raids caught the attention of the central Sassanid government, who led a number of exhibitions to try and silence this deadly new threat. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_white_huns_2_2_description	The White Huns never made it all the way to the heartland of the Sassanid Empire, preferring instead to negotiate lucrative peace agreements. However, had they so wished, they may have managed to capture Ctesiphon, the Sassanid capital.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_white_huns_3_2_description	Despite the tribal, heterogeneous nature of the White Huns' confederation, later kings began to assume the trappings of the all powerful rulers they encountered on their travels. Khingila, for example, harnessed the propaganda value of minted coins, producing money in the style of the Gupta Emperors to demonstrate his power to all the world.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_white_huns_4_2_description	Although advances in siegecraft meant little during field battles on the steppes, the nomadic tribes quickly realised how to break into the walled cities of the civilised world to obtain the riches found within. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_white_huns_5_2_description	Unlike the more famous western Huns, who were chiefly concerned with extracting money from the great powers of the age, the White Huns instead wished to establish permanent rule over the eastern nations they conquered. Where better to start than the capital of the greatest Empire of the day?	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_white_huns_1_3_description	Nomadic tribes such as the White Huns were the ultimate opportunists, ravaging undefended territory and then accepting huge sums in bribes or 'tribute' to leave and visit their slaughter upon other lands. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_white_huns_4_3_description	The leader of a group as diverse as the White Huns occasionally had to resort to drastic, brutal measures to ensure that his position remained unchallenged from within.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_white_huns_5_3_description	Even the vast domains of the Sassanids did not satisfy the White Huns' desire for conquest. Had they succeeded in their ultimate aims, the Eastern Roman Empire, perched so close to Ctesiphon, would surely have fallen next.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_white_huns_1_1_description	The White Huns, already a powerful force in the east, were attracted to the fertile western provinces of the Sassanid Puppets. Weakened by the instability brought about by the mass migrations, these lands yielded easy pickings for the nomadic warriors.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_white_huns_2_1_description	Key to the success of the White Huns was their ability to ally with and subjugate rival nomadic groups. The Uars and the Kidarites are just two examples of proud tribes who rode to war under White Hun banners. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_white_huns_3_1_description	At the start of the 5th century AD, a number of barbarian confederations began migrating westward, throwing the land into a cycle of more than a century of constant warfare and migration to avoid the nomadic marauders' clutches.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_white_huns_4_1_description	The leaders of the White Huns drew legitimacy from their ability to provide riches for the whole confederation, not just for themselves and their immediate associates. By threatening weaknesses in the soft underbelly of the Sassanid Empire, they were oft able to extort great sums of gold without even striking a blow. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_white_huns_5_1_description	Crushing large empires rapidly became a pastime for the White Huns. In the east, the Indian Gupta Empire buckled under their relentless assault. At one point, there was every chance the Sassanid Empire would go the same way; had the White Huns mounted a more sustained attack, rather than been unwilling to negotiate a pay-off, the outcome may have been very different.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alans_1_1_description	The coming of the Huns dealt a devastating blow to the many tribes and minor kingdoms not strong enough to resist them. The Alans were among those compelled to flee; theirs was an enforced migration that lasted for many years.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alans_2_1_description	A great number of Alans migrated westward, where they encountered the Vandals attempting to cross the Rhine. Joining forces against their common enemies, their paths would cross paths repeatedly throughout the Migration Period.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alans_3_1_description	After entering Gaul, a group of Alans under King Respendial migrated through the Iberian Peninsula, before settling in the former Roman territories of Lusitania and Carthaginensis.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alans_5_1_description	The Visigoth invasion of the Iberian Peninsula ended in the death of the Alanic king. Therefore, the Alans were compelled to seek protection from their old allies, the Vandals. It is likely the Vandals would have needed the same support had they been the first to meet the Visigoths.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alans_1_2_description	The Alans shared their origins with the Sarmatian tribes of the eastern steppes. Despite undergoing radical changes during their great migration and subsequent period of settlement, they maintained a reputation for equestrian excellence.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alans_2_2_description	The Alans were divided in two by the Hunnic invasion. The eastern Alans eventually settled in Sarmatia Asiatica, an area later known as the kingdom of Alania.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alans_3_2_description	Once united with like-minded tribes during their migration, the western Alans and their allies became sworn enemies of the Western Romans.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alans_4_2_description	As the western Alans migrated away from them westwards, their eastern counterparts did much the same, eventually appearing as far east as Scythia.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alans_5_2_description	The Visigoths were victorious in Spain, driving the Alans and the Vandals into Africa. Here they established a joint kingdom which gradually became the dominant power in the western Mediterranean.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_1_1_description	The general Stilicho, for a time the most powerful man in the Western Empire, was successful in putting to flight the barbarian tribes who attempted to cross the Rhine. The migrating Suebi were forced away from Rome, moving instead west towards the Pyrenees.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_2_1_description	The path of the Suebi's migration eventually led them to Hispania. However, the land was hotly contested by both the Vandals and the Visigoths. Yet Hispania would be made Suebi - by force if necessary…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_3_1_description	In AD448, Rechiarus ascended to the Suebi throne. As the first Catholic monarch of their kingdom, he began converting his population to Catholicism, at a time when the religion was rapidly spreading across the world.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_4_1_description	In AD586 the kingdom of the Suebi effectively ended when it was annexed by the Visigoths. Had they survived, their kingdom would have had to sustain itself through both internal efforts and external trade.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_5_1_description	Any kingdom with its sights on controlling Europe would have had to face off with Rome who, despite its vulnerabilities, remained a force to be reckoned with. Far east in Constantinople lay true victory!	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_1_3_description	Even before the Migration Period, the Suebi were adept at moving in search of better lands. Their small huts, barely permanent structures, and subsistence farming methods meant that they could, with ease, pick up their belongings and move on.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_2_3_description	Late antiquity brought an end to ways of life established over the previous thousand years. Empires were collapsing and the world itself was changing. Those without the strength to defend themselves were invariably swept away by the tide of change.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_3_3_description	Tarraconensis eluded Suebi control in Rechiarus' lifetime. In AD455 he led an unsuccessful attack on the Romans and Visigoths. Had he won, however, all of Hispania would have been open to him.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_4_3_description	To control a kingdom, a king must keep as many people happy as possible. Those who could not be swayed with the truth of God, or military power, could generally be bought for cold, hard coin.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_5_3_description	The Vandals, previously foes of the Suebi, established themselves in Africa, taking residence at Carthage. A hotly contested and wealthy area, it would be put to much better use under Suebi control.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_1_2_description	On their migration to Spain, the Suebi needed to pass through Frankish territory; the Rhine had to be crossed and those in the Suebi's path moved aside. If the Franks had attempted to stop them their fate would have been sealed.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_2_2_description	Historically, the Suebi were ignored by the warring Vandals and Visigoths, who deemed them insignificant. However, had they amassed enough strength to fight, they could have been contenders.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_3_2_description	Rechiarus was a particularly belligerent king, leading the Suebi on repeated raids into the Ebro Valley and across Tarraconensis. Yet he also made peace with the Romans, though this peace was doomed to be characteristically short-lived.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_4_2_description	If the Suebi were to survive antiquity, they could not do so alone. With the Romans before them, and the Vandals and Visigoths surrounding them, it would have been prudent to make friends where possible.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_suebi_5_2_description	The Roman Empire extended its reach across the Mediterranean, from eastern Europe to Egypt. Any nation wanting to contest Imperial power must also dominate the waves.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_1_2_description	Under the rule of the Emperors, Christianity flourished across Rome's entire domain, but particularly the capital cities of the Eastern and Western Empires.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_2_2_description	Due to the Empire's size, it was practical to decentralise much of its administrative infrastructure. However, keeping so many powerful governors in line was a troubling prospect.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_3_2_description	Due to the Empire's vast size, it was impossible to keep forces along the entire border. The Roman Empire adopted new military strategies to cope with the numerous barbarian incursions.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_4_2_description	In order to prevent the already thinly-stretched Roman forces from succumbing to nomadic forces on multiple fronts, the Eastern Emperors paid tribute to the Huns.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_5_2_description	Although it was decriminalised under Constantine, Christianity had some way to go before it became Rome's official state religion. Theodosius II strove to legitimise and spread his faith throughout the Empire.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_1_3_description	During the fracturing of the Empire, much knowledge and organisation was lost. It was therefore up to law makers and their administrators to repair that damage.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_2_3_description	As Rome's enemies changed, military reforms occurred to meet that threat. A faster, more reactive force was proposed. Cavalry was an essential part of this.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_3_3_description	North Africa was the chief source of food for both the Eastern and Western Empires. As such, it was known as "the breadbasket of Rome".	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_4_3_description	Following their migration to Africa, the Vandals became a major threat to the Roman control of the region. Both Empires, realising the importance of this, sent troops to combat them. Eventually, the Romans ceded many of their lands to the barbarians. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_5_3_description	The Roman Empire was considered the centre of the known world - indeed all roads did lead to Rome. Organised tax collecting, well-established trade routes and a steady supply of commodities, it's income was the envy of every other power.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_1_1_description	With Roman forces on both sides of the Empire weakened from the division and the rigours of almost-continuous warfare, they relied on the small groups of available mercenaries.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_2_1_description	As the defence of the Empire's borders became a priority, lightly-armoured Palatine troops, previously employed for Imperial escort duties, were redistributed along the frontier. Their role was to patrol and defend the borderlands from barbarian incursions.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_3_1_description	Though divided, the Empire enjoyed religious unification through the Christian faith. With Orthodoxy in the East and Catholicism in the West, both halves became devoutly Christian.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_4_1_description	With the turbulent courts of the two Empires, it was only a matter of time before tensions broke. Following the death of Emperor Honorius, Joannes was crowned Western Roman Emperor. However, Theodosius II had raised his own candidate, Valentinian III, making civil war inevitable.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_roman_5_1_description	Having extracted much tribute from the Romans, the Huns continued to attack them regardless. Enough was enough; payments were stopped and Rome's war banners were raised.	true

mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_mercia_1_1_description	Offa, the famed king of Mercia, inherited a fractured kingdom, so set about uniting the lands around his domain. Throughout his reign he struggled against the various Welsh kingdoms on numerous occasions in the space of just twenty years.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_mercia_2_1_description	While Wessex was previously part of the Mercian domain, Aethelbald’s death divided the kingdom. Cyenwulf managed to take control of Wessex and defend it valiantly against Offa, the new Mercian king. In AD786, however, he was murdered and Beorhtric - a man loyal to Offa - was installed in his place.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_mercia_3_1_description	One of the few enduring elements of Offa’s reign is the massive earthwork defences built along the Welsh border, known as ‘Offa’s Dyke’. Stretching nearly 150 miles, it both laid claim to Mercian territory and provided a platform from which to launch further assaults across the border.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_mercia_4_1_description	While the Mercians were engaged in their grand re-unification, the neighboring Kingdom of Northumbria experienced the beginnings of what became the greatest crisis to face the British Isles since the Roman invasion over seven centuries previous. In AD793, the Vikings raided the island monastery of Lindisfarne, opening the floodgates to hordes of Nordic marauders for years to come. Swift reprisals may have stemmed the flow of raiders before it became a tide.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_mercia_5_1_description	One of the more interesting documents from this period is a communication between Charlemagne and Offa. The Frankish king contacted the Mercian to suggest that his son marry Offa’s daughter. In return, Offa suggested his son marry Charlemagne’s daughter as well – effectively suggesting the two powers were equals. Charlemagne was furious and cut off all communication. Perhaps Offa should have followed up his prideful words with an invasion?	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_mercia_1_6_description	Offa’s reign saw a financial innovation that has endured to this day – the introduction of the pound as England’s currency. To reflect changes made to the Frankish system, a new silver coin was introduced – the penny - that, in groups of 240, weighed the same as a pound. This basic ratio between the pound and its fractions remained in place until 1970, when Great Britain joined the System Internationale – generally known as the ‘metric’ system.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_nords_1_2_description	Folklore tells of numerous raids into northern Germania, such was the Nordic peoples' love of plunder and riches above all else.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_nords_2_2_description	Jordanes, Roman historian, spoke of Scandza, a great island in the northern sea. Its inhabitants were a warlike and fearsome group, amongst whom he counts the Geats, Danes and Jutes.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_nords_3_2_description	Although far removed from the Hunnic invasions and the chaos that ensued, folk legend speaks of Nordic involvement in the conflict between their Gothic cousins and the Huns.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_nords_4_2_description	The later Varangian Nords were known for their trade with the eastern empires following their exploration of the Volga. As such, Moramar became a vitally important trading post along the route to the Far East.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_nords_1_3_description	Later history has shown that the Nordic people had a flair for shipbuilding and seafaring, allowing them to plunder and eventually settle far from their homelands.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_nords_2_3_description	The later Varangian Nords were known for their trade with the eastern empires following their exploration of the Volga. However, land trade with Asia began when they reached the shores of the Sarmatian Sea, at the mouth of the Duna River.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_nords_3_3_description	It was by naval strength as much as fighting skill that the Nordic tribes developed their reputation: more ships could carry more warriors to raid and conquer.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_nords_1_1_description	The Nordic peoples had a reputation for belligerence, but even they struggled against the increasingly-powerful kingdoms rising to the south - notably the equally-bellicose Saxons.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_nords_2_1_description	The Nordic tribes plundered riches from weaker peoples. The Jutes, for example, were purported to have raided Britain as early as the turn of the 5th century AD, and later Viking invasions of Britain became the stuff of legend.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_nords_3_1_description	Over time, the Nordic tribes became infamous across northern Europe. Named after their word for a raiding expedition, the 'Vikings' conquered far and wide, reaching Iceland and possibly even the Americas.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_nords_4_1_description	In spite of the Nordic people's reputation for violence and plunder they were later lauded for their mercantile sense, as they traded the length and breadth of Europe and the Near East. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_nords_5_1_description	The Nordic and Germanic tribes, and their successor nations, became known for their rich folklore. Sagas of gods and heroes were handed down from one generation to the next, immortalised in stone as well as through oral tradition.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_1_4_description	In the wake of Belisarius' victory at Ad Decimum, Carthage fell easily. However, the fear of a Vandal counterattack meant that fortifications were hastily strengthened, lest Belisarius immediately lost his hard-won prize.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_2_4_description	In December AD536, Belisarius entered Rome, the ancient capital and former centre of Imperial power. This symbolic victory may well have been all-consuming, and laid the groundwork for the restoration of a new, entirely separate Roman Empire.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_3_4_description	Belisarius was poised to seize total victory when he was recalled by Justinian which, in many ways, squandered his efforts. At the siege of Ravenna, the Goths offered him kingship rather than endure continued subservience to Justinian. What would have happened had he earnestly accepted the throne?	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_4_4_description	Had Belisarius marched into Ravenna and declared himself Western Emperor, then it is doubtless that war with his former masters would have been inevitable and immediate. In the long run, this war may have been protracted and bloody, but necessary. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_5_4_description	The wildcard during the reconquest of Italy was the sudden appearance of the Franks, who repeatedly invaded across the Alps, causing setbacks for the Imperial campaign. However, in AD554 they were finally pushed back once and for all at the River Volturnus.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_1_5_description	Ad Decimum was the last serious Vandal attempt to resist to Rome, Carthage capitulating soon after without putting up much of a fight. Subsequently, the population boasted of city's strategic value, joyous at the return to Roman rule.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_2_5_description	Vandal Africa was an embarrassment to Justinian, as the Vandals continued to concede the Empire's suzerainty over them. To this end, every trace of their culture and religion was removed, as if it had never been.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_3_5_description	Although Rome was the original seat of Imperial power, Ravenna had been the government's home for years before the Western Empire fell, as it was well-placed to avoid being sacked by the marauding Huns. Naturally, any claimant to the Imperial throne would want to seize the old administrative hub for himself.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_4_5_description	Following his redeployment to the east, Belisarius was sent back to Italy as the situation there deteriorated in his absence. However, he was unable to replicate his previous success, as Justinian's capricious jealousy saw to it that he was denied the manpower he required to secure total victory.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_5_5_description	Wars and plagues took their toll on the Roman Empire's populace and so increasingly it relied on mercenaries to fight its battles. Seen as expendable, those who sympathised with the Ostrogoths were placed in the front line so they were directly in harm's way.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_1_6_description	Belisarius' victory in Africa must have been a heady tonic - the temptation to claim the kingdom as his own must have been strong. Yet he knew that Justinian was watching, and loyalty to the Emperor stayed Belisarius' hand.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_2_6_description	In AD546 Belisarius finally reclaimed Rome, the eternal city, in the name of the Empire. Rome, ancient capital of the Republic, then seat of the Empire, had symbolic - far more than strategic - value.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_3_6_description	Belisarius entered Ravenna in May AD540, finally subduing the Ostrogothic remnants who had previously offered to make him Emperor of a revitalised Western Rome. Belisarius feigned acceptance, then seized the city in the name of Justinian once he had arrived.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_4_6_description	Belisarius had, by this point of his career, been relegated by the Emperor, whose jealousy now saw rivals ascend beyond the former first general. All the same, his own loyalty sharpened Belisarius' focus, and he continued to fight for the Emperor.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_5_6_description	Belisarius, a man forged by the Empire, helped to reforge it in his turn. Despite the machinations of those around him, Belisarius' personal honour, and his impact on the Empire, survived long after both his and Justinian's deaths.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_2_7_description	Belisarius' campaigns of reconquest had so far been a trial, but triumphant. Justinian was pleased, and the general continued to enjoy the Emperor's good graces. Now, the rest of Italy was waiting his attentions, but Justinian was watching with interest his every move.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_3_7_description	Justinian must have felt threatened by Belisarius as, no sooner had Ravenna been conquered, he was redeployed away from the Italian front. Yet Belisarius' loyalty to him, and to the Empire, never wavered.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_1_1_description	Justinian saw opportunity for invasion when Gelimer's Vandal Kingdom showed signs of fracturing. The revolution of Godas in Sardinia gave him reason enough to dispatch an expedition to the region.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_2_1_description	Roman Africa continued to be raided by the Moors long after Belisarius' victory, hampering progress to stabilise the region. Had their defeat come quicker, then Belisarius would have gained a further time advantage in the Ostrogothic War to come.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_3_1_description	Narses was a rival general who accompanied Belisarius on parts of his Italian campaign. Though talented, he disagreed with Belisarius on several occasions, leading revolts within the army's ranks and almost causing Rome's strategy to fail.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_4_1_description	Although many of the Ostrogoths had been put to the sword, they resurged under Totila, quickly seizing control of much of the Italian countryside. His efforts disrupted the flow of income to the Empire, leaving them little funds with which to combat this renewed Gothic aggression.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_5_1_description	After the fall of Ravenna, the Empire's primary foe were Totila's Ostrogothic resurgents. The Battle of Taginae in AD552 saw the Gothic leader put to the sword and the Ostrogoths pushed out of Italy entirely, and for good.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_1_2_description	The Moors and Berbers surrounding the Vandal Kingdom were, at first, happy to recognise Justinian's authority over it. Therefore, Belisarius was able to exact tribute from them to prove their loyalty to the Emperor.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_2_2_description	Gothic inaction and dynastic dispute is what gave Justinian casus belli for invasion. Belisarius exploited this instability to make rapid gains. The shaky Gothic leadership were key, targeting them would further destabilise the kingdom.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_3_2_description	Sometimes the whim of fate, cruel in its indifference, decides the fate of nations rather than man. The Franks under Theudebert came close to frustrating both Gothic and Imperial ambitions, but were struck down and near-wiped out by dysentery. However, some fates can be mitigated against...	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_4_2_description	Man is ever fickle, especially where power is concerned. So it was with the Goths, who attempted to appease Justinian on several occasions, whilst trying to placate other barbarian kingdoms at the same time. With better intelligence, Belisarius' could have used these fragile alliances to his advantage…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_5_2_description	The invasions of the Ostrogoths, as well as the widespread destruction of the old Roman lands, meant that much important knowledge was lost. A determined technological and academic effort would have been required to lift the land out of ruin.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_1_3_description	After the Battle of Ad Decimum, Belisarius captured Carthage, sitting upon Gelimer's throne in the name of the Emperor. Yet, as he enjoyed the feast prepared for Gelimer in the sure certainty of the Vandal king's victory, he could have taken the throne for himself.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_2_3_description	Dalmatia was one of the Empire's first targets in its campaign to reclaim Italy; securing it would allow the straightforward passage of its armies into northern Italy, making the rest of the campaign run more smoothly. Yet fortune was fickle - initial victories were squandered, meaning Dalmatia had to be repeatedly recaptured, diverting Rome's military resources from their chief task.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_3_3_description	Mediolanum was another of Belisarius' chief targets. Although it was eventually captured, a Burgundian relief force at one point besieged it and, after a protracted struggle, forced a surrender and razed the city. In hindsight, it may have been more prudent for Belisarius to deny it to anyone and destroy it himself.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_4_3_description	Holding the reclaimed Italian lands became a serious problem for Belisarius, as the determined Goths persisted in their attempts to retake their lost kingdom. For Rome's first general, constant vigilance and savvy strategy were required to hold back the tribal tide.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_expedition_5_3_description	At Western Rome's height, the Emperor securely controlled southern Gaul, all of Italy and northern Africa. Any man who aspired to the throne would also dream of reaching that same apex.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_1_3_description	Moving his forces into the province of Belgica, King Chlodio met and defeated the Roman forces at Cambrai, where he established a foothold for his people.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_2_3_description	Politics in the Frankish nation was a complex affair, as a king's reign rested entirely on the goodwill of his subjects. A weak leader, or one who attempted to bend the tribes to his will, could expect to be removed by those he led.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_3_3_description	It was rare for the Franks to take cavalry into battle, preferring instead to use their numerous horses for agriculture. Event though these strong steeds proved extremely effective at the charge, they could not be used for sustained melee.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_4_3_description	The Franks' secret weapon was the Francisca, a deadly throwing axe. When charging into enemy lines it was thrown prior to the impact, shattering enemy shields and killing many in the front line.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_5_3_description	Merovech was a legendary warrior among the Franks, so much so that his successors styled themselves the 'Merovingians' - adding legitimacy to their reigns by claiming descent. Following their momentous rise to power, the Merovingians quickly eclipsed the other Frankish tribes. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_1_2_description	In Frankish society a freeman, otherwise known as a 'baro', was considered the lowest rank of nobility. As such, they held land and were able to pass it to their heirs. Baro were also expected to answer the call to war.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_2_2_description	Within Roman society, Franks enjoyed a great measure of prosperity. Many were educated - a prerequisite to holding positions within the Roman administrative system - and also employed as generals in the Legions. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_3_2_description	Each year, the disparate Frankish tribes congregated to discuss their campaign goals for the coming year. During this time they also traded with one another and discussed matters of politics and succession. Members of other Germanic tribes were also involved in this process.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_4_2_description	Salian Law was in use for many years before it was codified at the end of the 5th century AD. Mainly concerned with matters of inheritance and custom, it was the first legal document to promote Agnatic Succession; where only the male members of a family could inherit titles or land.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_5_2_description	As the Roman Empire grew weaker, the Franks quickly established a foothold in Gaul. By the end of the 5th century AD, they had conquered or subjugated the entire region, establishing a border which lasted for hundreds of years.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_1_1_description	After the failed invasion of Rome by the Franks, and the loss of one of their leaders, Sunno, his brother Marcomer suggested that the disparate tribes be united under a single king. He proposed his own son Pharamond, who is considered one of the first Frankish kings.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_2_1_description	The Franks claimed to be descended from Wodan, the highest of the pagan gods and lord of battle, wisdom, poetry and magic. Gods of such power were often honoured by the Franks, who marked hills and forests as sacred areas for worship.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_3_1_description	The Frankish king, Chlodio, tired of his people's status as foederati of the Romans, and decided to seize the initiative. Gathering together his dispersed tribesmen, he marched ever deeper into Roman territory.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_franks_5_1_description	In AD451 Roman and Hunnic armies met on the field at Chalons, in the north of Gaul. In the run up to the battle, the Roman general, Flavius Aetius, called the foederati to arms. The Franks duly answered, led by Merovech, their legendary leader. The alliance successfully pushed back the Hunnic hordes, marking the beginning of the end for Attila in Western Europe.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_3_6_description	Though the Ostrogoths were put to rout by Belisarius’ campaign, Roman failure to consolidate this victory allowed the Ostrogoths, under Totila, to revive themselves and wage war anew on Rome - war that would halt Roman progress in Italy altogether.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_1_4_description	Italy was wrested from Odoacer's hands by the strong Ostrogothic ruler, Theoderic, and his powerful army. If he was to hang on to it that strength would have to endure. If Justinian intended to reconquer lost Imperial lands, the Ostrogoths needed to show they would not fold easily.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_2_4_description	Belisarius' success against the Ostrogoths was largely due to the speed of his assault. He was able to swiftly divide the kingdom and isolate pockets of Gothic resistance. A unified enemy would have been more difficult to overcome.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_3_4_description	Mediolanum was an important target for Belisarius. Although the population offered it to him, dissent within Roman ranks led to its reconquest by the Ostrogoths, following a lengthy siege.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_4_4_description	Although abandoning much of their tribal roots, the new barbarian kingdoms nevertheless placed a premium on individual strength, and personal power still paved the road to greatness.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_5_4_description	In the recent past, most barbarian income came from raids on the lucrative cities of the Empire. Whilst this continued - their raids making them fabulously wealthy - they also adapted the efficient Roman infrastructure to their own needs, which enabled barbarian society to prosper.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_1_5_description	The Visigoths, established in Hispania after their migration, were once subservient to their Ostrogothic kin. Now, though independent of each other, they both remembered the value of comradeship during hard times.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_2_5_description	When Belisarius marched into Rome and reclaimed the ancient seat of Imperial power, he did so largely without a struggle. Had the Ostrogoths put up a more vigorous defence, Belisarius may never have made it.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_3_5_description	Belisarius' relentless advance, and his opponents' inherent weakness, enabled him to easily subdue the Ostrogoths. An inability to maintain water and food supplies caused many cities to capitulate without offering any resistance. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_4_5_description	The barbarian kingdoms were inheritors of some of the wealthiest of Roman lands, including some with silver and jewel deposits. Combined with their legacy of exquisitely crafted jewellery, the resulting products truly were wonders to behold.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_5_5_description	In barbarian tradition, the strongest was usually the leader; hereditary succession was not considered if the ancestor held no power. Yet when inhabiting the infrastructures of the former Roman Empire, this became a consideration, in many cases for the first time.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_1_2_description	Strength and tenacity had allowed the barbarian kingdoms to arise from the ashes of the crumbling Roman Empire, yet a softness developed amongst the tribes after they settled. Their once-fierce warriors would need training if they were to win wars for their new kings.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_2_2_description	Old habits die hard. Though settled and almost civilised, the barbarians still fed on Rome's weaknesses, raiding its lands whenever the opportunity arose.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_3_2_description	A clash of religious ideals occurred when the barbarians encountered the predominant 'Chalcedonian' form of Christianity, which the Western Empire had already propagated within its provinces. To the new kings, this just would not do…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_4_2_description	Had the Romans failed to break the Ostrogoths' power, their hold on Italy would only have been strengthened. From there, the reunion of the Ostrogoths and Visigoths tribes may have given them total hegemony over the region.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_5_2_description	Despite his defeat of the Ostrogoths, Belisarius' hold on Italy was shaky. His immediate withdrawal to deal with the Sassanid Persians left a power vacuum and a Roman army without solid direction. In due time, the Romans were pushed back by Totila, the new, strong Gothic leader.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_1_3_description	The Ostrogothic queen, Amalasuntha, was raised with Roman culture and so was very pro-Roman in her adult life. She allowed Justinian bases in Sicily during the Vandalic War, courting the Empire's favour whenever she could.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_2_3_description	The death of Theoderic and the subsequent imprisonment of Amalasuntha destroyed the carefully constructed Ostrogothic-Roman relations, giving Justinian the excuse he needed to invade Italy. He deployed Belisarius - fresh from his victory over the Vandals - to see it done.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_3_3_description	Theoderic saw to it that the Ostrogoths' relationship with the Burgundians was solidified by marriage between the two kingdoms. Eventually, the Burgundians were consumed by the Franks, but remained staunch allies of the Ostrogoths.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_4_3_description	The Franks, inheritors of Gaul and a power very much on the ascendant, were fickle and deceptive, turning on their Gothic allies when their need was greatest.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_5_3_description	Rome's failure to secure Italy, and the decline in Ostrogothic power, enabled the Langobards to sweep down through Italy and claim it for themselves. A powerful Gothic kingdom could have stopped this from happening, bringing about a very different outcome.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_1_1_description	The history of the barbarian kingdoms is marked by the advent of more sophisticated, proto-Medieval hierarchies. Yet the old ways died hard, and dynastic disputes plagued the new realms. However, there was always one simple solution for dealing with would-be usurpers...	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_2_1_description	The Migration Period saw many barbarian groups displaced by the Huns, so they settled and formed kingdoms far from their homelands. This new-found strength could not last forever, not alone - allies were needed if they were to maintain their hold on their new homes.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_3_1_description	Inheriting former Imperial infrastructures meant that the barbarian kingdoms ruled over predominantly non-native populations. As a result, the native nobility tried to promote their legitimacy whenever possible.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_4_1_description	Ostrogothic history was always violent. Theoderic murdered Odoacer personally during a feast to claim the crown for himself. If the Romans were to be defeated, then Belisarius must fall in the same way, with Ostrogothic hands around his throat.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_bel_ostrogothi_5_1_description	Italy was the spiritual home of the Roman Empire, but now it belonged to the Ostrogoths. Rome itself was failing, crumbling behind its walls; the Ostrogoths should have been the ones to finish the job, in return for centuries of mistreatment at Roman hands.	true
mission_text_text_pro_build_farm_adrianople_description	Our livestock have no place to graze now that the people are concentrated in towns once more. Converting some countryside around Adrianople to farmland would help sustain us as we seek to rebuild.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_1_1_description	Hibernians and Britons were relatively isolated from the wider world by the surrounding oceans, so gaining knowledge of the world beyond their boundaries required they become sailors. So sailors they became - and some of the finest in the world.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_2_1_description	Early Hibernian literature such as the Ulster Cycle speaks of huge raids, during which great clan champions led armies against one another, and defined the fates of thousands through their actions. These mythical champions went on to inspire Ebdanian bravery in late antiquity.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_3_1_description	Leadership in Celtic clans was conferred upon the strongest of the same kin, but that leader ruled only as long as his strength lasted. Threats could come from anyone with the power to challenge within the chieftain's own family…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_4_1_description	Though far flung from the Ebdanian homeland, the island settlement of Gortyna, Crete gave a commanding view of the Mediterranean. Any sea-raiding nation could hold power if they seized it. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_5_1_description	As late antiquity progressed into the Dark Ages, the world became a much harsher place. It was not a place for the raiding, unsettled tribes of old. A modern marauding nation would need to adapt, or die.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_1_3_description	Western Rome's declining power opened up its still-vast wealth for the taking, but there were many interested parties. Whoever struck first would be best placed to claim the remnants of the once-mighty Empire's fortunes.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_2_3_description	Celts were ever belligerent, especially with one another. Tribal conflict was common, usually for survival but often to settle old grudges. The Picts, to the north of Britannia, held a valuable settlement in Tuesis that would have aided the Ebdanian cause greatly.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_3_3_description	The Western Empire is vast, and its forces too thinly spread to defend every frontier. With nomads massing in the east, Rome's gaze is elsewhere, leaving more western regions, such as Hispania, open to assault.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_4_3_description	As a sea-raiding nation, the Ebdanians knew the importance of controlling the waters they traversed. As their power grew and their influence spread, it became even more vital to ensure dominion over the waves.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_5_3_description	At the very eastern rim of the Mediterranean lies Constantia, on the island of Cyprus. From here, access to Antioch and the bulk of Asia Minor and Mesopotamia is possible. Holding it would provide a staging point for any nation hoping to move inland.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_1_2_description	In many ways, the splitting of the Roman Empire in AD395 left the West cut adrift. Beset by unruly foederati and weak governance, the opportunity for old enemies and oppressed subjects to seize power had finally arrived.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_2_2_description	From Hibernian shores, the Ebdanians were well positioned to assault the Gallic coast. The settlement of Elusa, just inland along the southwestern coast of Gaul, was unfortified - making it the perfect launchpad for raids into Hispania and Gaul.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_3_2_description	Carthago Nova was once the settlement from which the Carthage's Barca family built a fortune and planned the war that almost brought Rome to her knees. Whoever controlled it could control the region's silver production, and be well positioned to take advantage of the prosperous Mediterranean.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_4_2_description	The ancient capital of Carthage was utterly destroyed by the Roman Empire in the third and final Punic War, but the Romans later built on the site, knowing its economic and administrative value.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_ebdani_5_2_description	The Eastern Roman Empire, unlike its counterpart in the west, survived and flourished through late antiquity. The jewel of its economy was Alexandria, in Roman Egypt. Part of the "fertile crescent", it represented some of the Empire's most valued holdings.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_venedi_1_1_description	Unlike their Sclavenian cousins, the Venedians were not concerned with war – they simply wanted to secure their holdings and make a home. To this end, they fortified the boundaries of their land to make it defensible.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_venedi_2_1_description	The Venedians were most concerned with holding on to the land they controlled – specifically the fertile expanse between the Vistula and Daugava rivers .They established a societal structure there, with a tribal leader at the top to direct their actions. Although not a king by name, he was every inch in command.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_venedi_3_1_description	The Venedians were less aggressive than their Antean and Sclavenian brethren. They knew that the key to survival was not only belligerence, but diplomacy. On several occasions, and even with the Huns, the Venedians and were saved from destruction in this way.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_venedi_4_1_description	The Venedians, fathers of the Slavs, wanted simply to survive in a harsh world. Disinterested in war or expansionism or empire, they desired simply to find a place for themselves, away from the chaos, where they could live and prosper, unmolested by the world without.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_venedi_5_1_description	The Venedians were proud and mighty like the ancient yew, unmoving and resolute against a changing world. Across their territory they nurtured the land and their homes, hoping to achieve prosperity through diligence. 	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_1_1_description	The Himyarites became a regional power after conquering the neighbouring Sabaean Kingdom. This was the end a tumultuous time for the struggling people. From here, they could consolidate their position.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_2_1_description	Himyarite kings established their kingdom as an Arabian power through constant military campaigns. This eventually wore the men to mutiny, but before that they successfully conquered a large chunk of southern Arabia.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_3_1_description	Arabia was a hotly contested region, both for its wealth and for its access to the Silk Road and India's lucrative opportunities. Many forces, both Arabian and foreign, vied to control it. The Himyar, too, desired that power.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_4_1_description	Himyar abandoned paganism in the late 2nd century AD, when its king returned from campaign a converted man. The people resisted initially but eventually adopted the new religion.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_5_1_description	The Himyarites were, at several points, led by militant leaders who led them on raids around southern Arabia. They often installed governors in the places they conquered, but other times just pillaged for loot and moved on.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_1_3_description	Himyar occupied an advantageous position on the southern coast of what is now Yemen. With access to India and its valuable resources, those who controlled its territory would reap immediate rewards.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_2_3_description	Control of the Arabian sea was dependant on naval power. Aksum fielded a strong maritime force which helped it dominate the local trade routes to and from the east. Any nation wishing to wrest control would have to have a sizeable navy.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_3_3_description	Beyond the boundaries of Arabia lies Syria, perennially caught between the Sassanid Persians and Rome. Although the Himyarites never conquered as far north, there was great strategic promise in a region thrust between two great empires.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_4_3_description	Due to its important strategic position, Armenia fluctuated constantly between Roman and Sassanid control. Himyar, on the southern tip of Arabia, never conquered so far north. But as a would-be imperial power, why shouldn't they have set their sights further afield?	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_5_3_description	War was in the Himyar's blood; war to control Arabia and war to defend themselves against those who would take it away. Romans came and they fought, Aksum came and they fought. Against anyone, Himyar would fight.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_1_2_description	Himyarite rulers had long fostered good terms with Rome. King Charibael is said to have been a particular friend of the Roman Emperors, and they exchanged gifts often.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_2_2_description	The greatest power in the region during late antiquity was the Kingdom of Aksum, whose power extended into Arabia from its Ethiopian base. Himyar often warred with the Aksumites in the name of sovereignty and religion.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_3_2_description	The Eastern Roman Empire long coveted Arabian lands for access to the east and the wealth beyond. The Romans fostered protectorates through the region, but despite friendly overtures, the Himyarites resisted Roman influence.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_4_2_description	The conversion of Himyar to Judaism occurred from the top down. The power of its monarchy was unbroken for hundreds of years until the country was invaded by Aksum and forced to adopt Christianity. Had it remained free, however, Judaism would have continued to flourish there.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_himyar_5_2_description	Dominion over the Arabian Gulf and beyond was predicated on a powerful navy. If the Himyarites were to control the waves, and indeed the wealth that lay beyond, their naval forces would need to be impeccable.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_1_1_description	The 4th and 5th centuries AD were a tumultuous time for Europe, many tribes were forced to uproot and travel to new lands to avoid the crush of nations that ensued. The Saxons, being a sea-faring people, chose to cross the North Sea to the Britannia, which had been abandoned by the Western Romans. The journey was dangerous, with bad weather and bands of pirates combing the route.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_2_1_description	The Saxons were not a single nation, but a confederation of tribes led by their 'ealdormen', magistrates who convened annually to decide important issues. While all equals during peacetime, in times of war the ealdormen drew lots to decide who would lead the Saxon army to glory and death.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_3_1_description	In AD410 the Roman Emperor Honorious pulled his forces out of Britannia, effectively abandoning the colony to its fate. Due to their isolation and lack of military forces, the native Britons called upon the Saxons and the Angli to defend their shores.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_4_1_description	After the death of Vortimer, the new Saxon leader, Hengistus, called a council with the Vortigern, the leader of the Britons. Before the meeting, he ordered each of his house to hide a long blade upon their person. Shouting "Eu nimet saxas!" the Saxon nobles fell upon the arrayed Britons, killing all but Vortigern himself.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_5_1_description	Once Britannia was essentially subjugated and under Saxon rule, their leader's gaze fell upon Gaul. Striking deep into the heart of the Frankish territory, the Saxons advanced as far as Angers before being repulsed.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_1_2_description	Relations between the Chauci tribe of the Saxons and their Frankish neighbours had always been tense. War eventually broke out between them during the 4th century AD.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_2_2_description	With their mighty fleets and strong raiding bands the Saxons were a familiar sight on British shores long before they eventually settled. Saxon raiding parties struck all along the coasts of Britannia, looting and slaughtering before shipping  their plunder back across the sea.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_3_2_description	Forming the elite backbone of the Saxon infantry after the invasion of Britain, the 'hearthweru' - 'hearth guards' - served as police, bodyguards and as elite fighting men. When the tribes came together, the bulk of their combined army, commanded by their respective lords, were hearthweru.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_4_2_description	Like many of their barbarian kin, drinking was of major significance to the Saxons, and was often ritualised in the form of the 'Symbel'. Taking place in the great mead halls built for the Saxon leaders, the first drink was always poured by the lady of the house. Then, speeches were delivered, gifts given, boasts and mockery made, and mythical tales were told.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_5_2_description	With the Britons cowed, the Saxons then turned their attention to the Picts and Ebdani, who invaded from the north. Removing the teeth of these marauding tribes, who successfully traversed Hadrian's Wall on several occasions, was essential if their migration was to be successful in the long term.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_1_3_description	The Saxon peoples gradually spread right across Germania and Gaul. There is strong evidence that they settled in northeastern Gaul, where many Saxon-style graves have been found. Famed as mercenaries, they could often be found serving with the Roman army, whose chief duty to was to repel other groups of barbarians.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_2_3_description	Being a large confederation of tribes, the Saxon population was always sizeable. As such, they exerted much influence over the Frisian people - their much less numerous neighbours - and essentially controlled the entire region.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_3_3_description	The Saxons' economy was largely agrarian. During the period of Solmonath, their custom was to sow cakes into their fields, in a ritual known as the 'Field-Remedy'. The cake was made from sods of earth mixed with honey, milk and flour and then buried under the first furrow, where it was sanctified through prayer.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_saxons_4_3_description	In the cold winter months, known to the Saxons as Yule, they celebrated the 'Modraniht'. The rites, which likely included sacrifices to the Germanic deities, would continue through the night.	true

After this sacrilege, they understandably clung to their religion with a fierce tenacity.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_westphalia_1_1_description	For some time Charlemagne eyed Saxon lands, ripe as they were for conversion to the true religion. In AD772, a group sacked and looted a church in Deventer, near Utrecht. Charlemagne’s reprisals were swift and decisive – he invaded Saxon lands and destroyed pagan places of worship. This opening exchange set the tone of the war; if the Saxons had managed to hold onto their conquests, events may have unfolded entirely differently. 	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_westphalia_2_1_description	Charlemagne was not just content to menace the Saxons from the west, he also conspired with the Slavic Obotrites, settled to the rear of the Saxon lands, to attack them from the east. Their combined forces captured much territory previously under Saxon control, never to be reconquered. If the Saxons had subdued the Obodrites earlier, they could have focused their full attention on Charlemagne.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_westphalia_3_1_description	For many years the Saxons maintained spirited resistance in the face of overwhelming odds. Much of this was a response to the brutality meted out by Charlemagne, including the infamous massacre at Verdun. With the right leadership to direct this resistance, the Saxons might even have defeated their old foe, beset as he was on all sides.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_westphalia_4_1_description	Despite innumerable defeats, Saxon resistance refused to die. Whenever Charlemagne left their lands to campaign elsewhere they poured across the Rhine, ravaging and conquering every unprotected Frankish settlement in revenge for his savagery in the east. Taking out Charlemagne’s powerful southern population centres would have been a mighty blow.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_westphalia_5_1_description	The margins between victory and defeat are ever fine. While Charlemagne eventually shattered the Saxons and forced their conversion, they nevertheless won many decisive victories under Widukind. Had fortune favoured the Saxons, Europe may have seen the birth of a powerful, pagan empire.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_westphalia_1_6_description	The concept of Saxon identity is a hazy one.

The Migration Period perpetuated this fear, as the great tribal confederations swarmed westward, looting anything and everything in their path.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_barbarian_4_1_description	By the turn of the 5th century AD, the Roman ideal of 'civilisation' had spread to much of 'barbarian' Europe. However, this had done little to stem the tribes' continued pursuit of glory and riches. In fact, quite the opposite was true; the almost-constant warfare of the period and official corruption within the Roman Empire saw to that.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_barbarian_5_1_description	Long before the rise of the Roman Empire, the civilised world lived in fear of marauding barbarians out for plunder.

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_visigoths_1_1_description	Alaric of the Visigoths once fought for Rome, but abandoned them for their arrogant disregard of the sacrifices his people made to keep Constantinople free from molestation by the Huns. When he was crowned king, he immediately led his people against the Romans.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_visigoths_2_1_description	When the Western Roman Emperor Honorius instigated the massacre of Gothic families living and serving within his domain, Alaric rallied the survivors to his banner and declared war.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_visigoths_3_1_description	Despite their Germanic polytheistic origins, the Visigoths had become staunch Arian Christians by the time their migrations drew to a close.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_visigoths_4_1_description	Having established their capital in southern Gaul, the Visigoths quickly seized control of the surrounding area from the ever-weakening Western Roman Empire.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_visigoths_5_1_description	Attila the Hun posed a serious threat to everyone in Europe; his hordes swept from east to west, intimidating, sacking and subjugating all who stood in their path.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_visigoths_3_3_description	After a long period of migration, the Visigoths eventually settled in southern Gaul. Surprisingly, this was done with Rome's approval, as they hoped to enlist the Goths to defend their westernmost territories.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_visigoths_4_3_description	Despite a long and checkered history, the Visigoths frequently made truces with the Western Roman Empire. Initially, this was a matter of mutual protection, but by the Empire's end the Romans were just too weak to respond to a threat effectively.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_visigoths_5_3_description	Despite its barbarian origins, the Visigothic Kingdom went on to set the standard for law-making. King Chindasuinth began compiling the Lex Visigothorum, a code of laws safeguarding the rights of all his subjects in equal measure, regardless of their origins.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_visigoths_1_2_description	Deterred from attacking Constantinople, Alaric led his people southward into Greece, where they laid waste to cities such as Athens, Sparta and Corinth.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_visigoths_2_2_description	Conflicts of interest with the Western Roman Empire resulted in the Visigoths laying siege to Rome on several occasions. When the city eventually capitulated, it was sacked but survived largely unscathed.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_visigoths_3_2_description	Bad blood ran between the Visigothic Balti and Amali families. After King Ataulf - a Balti - slayed his enemy Sarus - an Amali - he himself was murdered and Sarus' brother, Sigeric, illegally claimed the throne. Sigeric proceeded to kill Ataulf's family, an act for which he himself was assassinated. The Balti leader, Wallia, was then made king.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_visigoths_4_2_description	The Western Roman Empire enlisted Visigothic help to wage war against the tribes that had invaded Hispania, but as Roman power waned nothing could prevent the Visigoths from simply taking the freshly 'liberated' territories for themselves.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_visigoths_5_2_description	The Visigoths ruled southern Gaul for many years before their defeat by the Franks. Their grip on Hispania, however, lasted well into the 7th century AD.	true

So sailors they became - and some of the finest in the world.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_celtic_2_1_description	In AD368, the greatest Celtic attempt to dethrone the Romans in Britain was put down with brutality by Count Theodosius. Yet now Western Rome is faltering, and unlikely to be able to stop another, better organised effort.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_celtic_3_1_description	With Rome evicted from Britannic and Hibernian shores, the tribes could decide who to war with next - even if it meant crossing into mainland Europe…	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_celtic_4_1_description	At the height of the Roman Empire, Imperial conquests stretched far and oppressed many, including the Celts. How glorious and just would it be to subjugate its shining capital city, just as they subjected others.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_celtic_5_1_description	Constantinople stood as a glittering testament to Imperial decadence. Beyond its walls lay treasures stolen from across the world. Those who broke down those walls and claimed what waited beyond would truly have tasted glory.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_celtic_1_2_description	Celtic warfare was for the most part about survival - raiding other tribes was when conflict most often occurred, out of need rather than imperialist desires. Raiding was part of their culture - it sustained them.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_celtic_2_2_description	The Celts often fought one another, over familial squabbles and for survival, yet Rome's hated imperialism could act as a catalyst for unity - the Empire could be repelled, if the tribes acted as one.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_1_2_description	War can be noble, but battle never is. The Alamanic tribes were well accustomed to battle and, when the fighting was done, taking what they could from those who had fallen. Ignoble maybe, but pragmatic.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_2_2_description	The Frankish Kingdom was a rising power in Europe during the Migration Period, and went on to establish itself as a major power in Italy and across all of Europe, including over territory belonging to the Alamans. As a result, any tribe wishing to thrive coveted Frankish lands... 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_3_2_description	King Chnodomar of the Alamans was renowned for his ability to hurl a lance from atop his steed. Although defeated at Argentoratum, the ferocity with which he fought was passed on to his people.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_4_2_description	Precious metals made impressive trinkets, but nothing displayed the power of an Alamanic king as much as gemstones. Set into crowns, bangles and even swords, glimmering jewels defined kingship in no uncertain terms.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_5_2_description	The tribal, polyarchic structure of the Alamans could never last if the tribes intended to forge an empire. A central governing body, ruled with a single purpose, would've been the only way to see greatness achieved.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_1_3_description	Available territory for migrating tribes was limited, and fiercely contested. The Roman Empires employed tribes to fight other tribes for them, which was in the vested interests of both parties.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_2_3_description	The Roman Army, by late antiquity, was a melting pot of foederati troops drawn from migratory and barbarian tribes. It was not uncommon for Imperial troops, therefore, to defect in support of their brothers and fight for the 'truer' cause.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_3_3_description	The Franks' power emanated from their capital. If the Alamans were to be the true inheritors of the Frankish legacy, and the usurpers to their throne, then they must hold both their own capital and sit upon the Frankish one as well.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_4_3_description	The Alamans were a people led by a council of many kings, each with their own agenda and allegiances. As they grew more powerful, the need for political machinations to keep the constituent tribes in line became necessary.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_5_3_description	The world is vast and full of treasures. Glory and wealth are rewarded to those who seek it out and claim it where it lies. Exotic goods from far afield would also have conferred strength and, subsequently, prestige upon the Alamans.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_1_1_description	The notion of 'conspicuous consumption' was one practised by the Alamans. The jewels and trinkets worn by their kings were demonstrations of their power, and, to those around them, a proud declaration of strength.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_2_1_description	The space for migrating tribes was limited, and the pressure upon the Roman Empires only increased as time went by. For those migrating, there was only one option for survival, and that was to take what they needed, and by force when necessary.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_3_1_description	The Franks owned vast swathes of land at their height, including Belgica and Lugdunensis. Had they been defeated, however, these highly-coveted lands would have been left open for the strongest faction to claim.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_4_1_description	The Alamans were defeated and subsumed before reaching their potential apex, but if they had achieved a vast power then it is likely that other Germanic tribes would have joined them to exact revenge on their old, now-crumbling Roman enemies.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_alamanni_5_1_description	Had the Alamans risen to supplant the Frankish Kingdom, then Italy and beyond would have been open to conquest by them. With no knowledge of when the cold would cease, prudence dictated that travelling ever-further south and west would benefit them.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_1_1_description	The main rivals of the Lakhmids were the Ghassanids, who occupied areas of the Levant close to Lakhmid settlements. As a client of an opposing power, the Lakhmids could not abide their presence.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_2_1_description	Although Lakhmid units were often seen in Persian battle ranks, the two neighbouring states often warred. In retaliation for raids into their territory, the Persian Shah Shapur II captured the Lakhmid capital, Al-Hira, in AD325, devastating the surrounding lands and exterminating the population.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_3_1_description	Inscriptions in Jordan and Namara indicate that at one point the Tanukhids and Lakhmids lived in close proximity to each other. In reality, both were born of the same tribal confederation, the Lakhmid dynasty emerging from a previously extinguished Tanukhid bloodline.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_4_1_description	Lakhmid cunning and subterfuge gave them an edge when gathering information and on the battlefield. It is said that a key factor in the Sassanid dynasty's eventual fall to Islam was the Lakhmids' promise to spy on their former allies.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_5_1_description	Arabia's wealth was drawn from its geographical location, which brought forth great opportunities for east to west trade. The nation that controlled the lion's share of the trade, therefore, would find itself almost needlessly wealthy.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_1_3_description	The Levant was a sought after region, and was constantly in a state of war. The Persians attacked it several times, and without their military presence the Lakhmids would have soon found themselves overwhelmed.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_2_3_description	With empires waging war in the north and east, and Arabian interests to the south, the Lakhmids must have seen the wisdom in raiding further into desert kingdoms, seeking the wealth and access that lay beyond.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_3_3_description	Sassanid injustice upon the Lakhmid people created deep wounds. The utter destruction of al-Hirah in AD325 no doubt left a lust for vengeance, something they would gladly take any opportunity to sate.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_4_3_description	The Tanukhids and Lakhmids were once part of the same confederation, a collection of Arabian tribes united for mutual gain. This sort of Arabian solidarity was crucial in deflecting the influence of Persia and Rome.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_5_3_description	Had the Lakhmids broken the power of the great empires, something else would be required to take its place. A Lakhmid empire could have extended its reach right across the region.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_1_2_description	The Lakhmid army played a crucial role in their society. Like the Tanukhids to the Romans, the Lakhmids were often used by the Sassanids for their military campaigns, and valued their skill in battle.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_2_2_description	The Eastern Roman Empire tried to influence Arabian affairs whenever it could, creating client states across the region. Though they promised to aid the Lakhmids defend themselves from the Persians, in reality this support never came.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_3_2_description	The Horn of Africa was dominated by the Aksumite Kingdom, which had great wealth and power stemming from its trade connections to India across the Arabian Sea. Such wealth could be claimed by anyone powerful enough to take them on.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_4_2_description	Ultimately, the Sassanid Empire was the greatest threat to the Arabian desert kingdoms. The Persian kings were allegedly disgusted by their ascetic lifestyles. For the Arab way of life to endure, the Sassanids would have to be stopped, for good.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_lakhmids_5_2_description	The Lakhmid dynasty eventually fell when the Sassanids annexed its state and installed their own governor. Until then, Lakhmid political influence was such that they were able to raise Bahram V to the Sassanid throne in AD420.	true
mission_text_text_mis_activity_defeat_army_invade	Defeat an invading army belonging to the following faction in battle: 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_nomadic_1_3_description	The Huns and other marauding tribes drafted warriors from subjugated kingdoms to fight for them. This made up for inadequacies amongst their own forces, and provided sheer weight of numbers, especially during sieges.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_nomadic_2_3_description	The nomadic way of life was one of perpetual movement. Unfortunately for the cities they conquered, this meant that occupation was out of the question: looting was the intention, and razing the preferred outcome.	true
mission_text_text_objective_sands_4_main_description	With every Arabian nation vying for power and control of the lucrative and advantageous region, existence was perilous and survival a struggle. Yet the victorious nation would have to endure, dominate the region and forge a new Empire.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_nomadic_1_2_description	While preferring to live on the move, nomadic tribes such as the Huns would often subjugate weaker factions. To govern was not the aim, they were instead extorted for wealth and military support.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_nomadic_2_2_description	Steppe people were master archers, capable of firing accurately from the back of a fast-moving horse - even as they were riding away from the enemy.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_nomadic_3_2_description	Nomadic life on the steppes revolved around the horse, used for transportation, sustenance and - of course - warfare. Horses and horsemanship were central to war and nomad society, and they were valued above any other treasure.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_vandals_2_1_description	In AD406 an especially harsh winter caused the river Rhine to freeze over, allowing various Germanic tribes to stream across the river into Gaul. While doing just that, the Vandals were attacked by a Frankish raiding party, who killed the Vandals' king, Godigisel. This crossing of the 'limes' - the border of Roman civilisation - is considered the beginning of the end for the Western Roman Empire.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_vandals_3_1_description	The new King of the Vandals, Gunderic, son of Godigisel, led his people across the Pyrenees, into Hispania. Forcing their way through the exhausted Roman garrisons, the Vandals laid claim to the region of Gallaecia.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_vandals_5_1_description	Continuing to build their new empire, the Vandals turned their attentions to Carthage, part of the breadbasket which fed Rome. To conquer this prosperous trading hub would truly be a jewel in the Vandals' crown. In 439, they attacked the city, conquering it without a fight, as the majority of the population were watching the races at the hippodrome. With the Roman garrison nullified, the Vandals quickly conquered the entire province of Africa.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_vandals_1_2_description	In AD401, with supplies at breaking point, and many thousands of mouths to feed, the Vandals attacked the Roman province of Raetia as they passed through it.

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_vandals_2_2_description	Having made it across the Rhine the Vandals, now led by their new king, Gunderic, marched their armies through Gaul, looting and pillaging as they went.

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_vandals_4_2_description	Tensions in Hispania continued to rise. In AD419, the Romans and the Suebi formed a coalition to forcibly remove the Vandals from the region. After a galling defeat at the Nervasos Mountain, the Vandals won consecutive victories against both the Romans in AD422, and the Suebi in AD428. The Suebi king, Heremigarius, was drowned at the Battle of Merida at Vandal hands.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_vandals_5_2_description	Whilst Roman attention was divided between wars on different fronts, the Vandals took this opportunity to re-establish a foothold in Europe.

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_vandals_4_3_description	In AD429, King Genseric led over 20,000 Vandals and Alans across the Straits of Gibraltar into Africa. The following year, the advancing Vandals laid siege to  the city of Hippo Regius, which took over fourteen months to fall. St Augustine, who was trapped inside the city, died during the siege. Following their victory the city became the Vandal Kingdom's first official capital.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_vandals_5_3_description	In order to make peace with the Vandals, Emperor Valentinian III promised his daughter to King Genseric's son.

mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_charlemagne_3_1_description	Though Charlemagne’s first campaign into Saxon lands was cut short by his Italian war, he soon returned. Penetrating deep into their lands, he destroyed sacred sites and forced their pagan lords to convert to Christianity.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_charlemagne_4_1_description	The Avars - a nomadic people who settled in Pannonia - launched a series of raids on Charlemagne’s eastern territories in AD788.

He reduced the Avar capital - the Great Ring - twice, looting centuries of raiding spoils in the process.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_charlemagne_5_1_description	After absorbing the Saxons, Charlemagne came into direct contact with the Danes. Many fleeing Saxons sought refuge in their territory, warning the rulers of Charlemagne’s mission to suppress their pagan beliefs. As a result, the Franks found Danish lands well-fortified and fiercely-defended; their failure to reduce it would come back to haunt them in later years. 	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_sclaveni_1_1_description	The Sclavenians were a highly aggressive people, always thirsty for war. They raided the lightly-defended Eastern Roman lands many times, and even made war with the almost-unstoppable Hunnic hordes. If the Sclavenians were ever offered a fight, they accepted!	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_sclaveni_2_1_description	If the Sclavenians knew one thing, it was war. They were a wholly-militarised people, focused on raiding, fighting and taking what they desired through brutal combat. Their army needed to be more than just a mindless rabble to maintain their martial superiority. 	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_sclaveni_3_1_description	The Sclavenians fought, fought again, then fought some more. War was in their blood and they sought battle at every opportunity.

mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_sclaveni_4_1_description	The Slavenians did not much care for the specifics of warfare – weapons, armour, discipline, etc. These things were all obtained on the battlefield, from the corpses of their defeated enemies.

mission_text_text_objective_sands_3_main_description	Romans had long been impressed with the wealth and prosperity of Arabia Felix ("Happy Arabia"), as they called it. Greener lands, abundant crops and trade possibilities made it a valuable and thus a hard area to control.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_1_3_description	As a nomadic people, the Tanukhids fought just to survive. Looting, pillaging, and sacking their targets not only enabled them to eat - it made them considerably wealthier over time.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_2_3_description	The tactics of the Tanukhids are considered an example of guerrilla warfare, as their nomadic raiding lifestyle complemented that style of fighting. From hidden desert bases, they would strike, loot, then disappear back into the sands.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_3_3_description	As the Sassanid Empire ascended in the north, replacing the Parthian Empire, the Tanukhids tried hard to resist their influence. The Persians represented a different culture and religion to their own, and were encroaching ever further into the Levant.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_4_3_description	The nomadic lifestyle of the Tanukhids meant that their dwellings were hastily erected yet designed to withstand the harsh Arabian heat. Buildings made of cotton - tents and pavilions - dotted their camps and temporary shelters.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_5_3_description	When Mavia, the Tanukhid warrior queen, went to war with Rome, her primary demand was the appointment of an Orthodox bishop for her devoutly religious people, which Rome had previously denied. One rebellion and many victories later, Mavia got the result she wanted.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_1_2_description	The Tanukhids had a rocky relationship with the Eastern Romans. Although employed as foederati, they eventually rebelled against the Empire to further their own social and religious aims, generally with great success.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_2_2_description	There are many reasons for the Tanukhids' migration, such as the collapse of the Ma'rib Dam, a catastrophe which caused the displacement of tens of thousands of people from southern Arabia.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_3_2_description	Tanukhid military might was based in large part on their unconventional tactics, but also on the strength of their numbers. Local Arabian support, gained as they campaigned throughout Arabia, bolstered their numbers.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_4_2_description	Following their conversion in the 3rd century, the religious fervour of the Tanukhids was said to be fanatical, something which endeared them somewhat to the Eastern Romans. They were said to be fiercely orthodox, and devoted to Thomas the Apostle.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_5_2_description	Tanukhid Christianity died with the emergence of the Rashidun Caliphate, when they converted to Islam. Until then they had been fiercely Christian since the 3rd century AD, having come into contact with the Orthodox faith whilst on military campaign.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_1_1_description	The Tanukhids were a people well used to the nomadic, roaming lifestyle. Constantly displaced, they settled where they could around south Arabia but independent tribes continued to pursue their own agendas.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_2_1_description	As nomads, the Tanukhids travelled far and wide. At several points in time they were foederati to the Eastern Roman Empire, even journeying as far as Constantinople itself to help defend the city from invaders.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_3_1_description	The Tanukhids first rebelled against the Roman Empire in a stunning action that took them all the way to the gates of Alexandria. A humiliated Emperor Valens was soon forced to capitulate to all their demands.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_4_1_description	Although often relied on to be foederati, the Tanukhids' relationship with the Empire was tempestuous at best. Several rebellions took place, all ending with peace between the two nations and often favourable terms for the Tanukhids.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_tanukhid_5_1_description	The Persian Empire under the Sassanids represented the greatest power in the east, strong enough to resist the Romans and with the temerity to conquer. Only through their subjugation would the Tanukhids know true freedom.	true

mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_sassanid_2_1_description	The western part of the Sassanid Empire was home to the desert peoples. Generally nomadic and peaceful, they proved inseparable from the lands they inhabited. Rather than wasting manpower by traversing the deserts to subdue them, the Sassanids preferred to keep relations cordial, even hiring them as mercenaries when the need arose.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_sassanid_3_1_description	The minting of coins was vital to the Sassanid administration. Produced from various metals, they were of a standardised in weight and have been found right across Europe and central Asia. During times of war, coins were minted in great numbers to fund the vast behemoth that was the Sassanian army.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_sassanid_4_1_description	The Sassanid Empire had no standing military force, instead relying on the civilian population to raise troops when conflict was imminent. Extended periods of war, therefore, made troop replenishment a problem. One solution was to resettle captured enemies, funding their existence from the state's coffers. These loyal men could then be called upon to fight when required.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_sassanid_5_1_description	Bahram V was a devout Zoroastrian. He made it his mission to build and devote temples to Ahura Mazda and the Great Fires, therefore keeping away the darkness of Ahriman.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_sassanid_1_3_description	The Sassanid Empire was ruled by the Shahanshah, with each territory handed over to lesser members of the family, who were known as the Shahdahr. The patronage, safety and loyalty of these petty kings was vital to the survival of the Shahanshah's regime.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_sassanid_1_2_description	The bulk of the Sassanid army comprised poorly-trained light infantry, conscripted from the lower echelons of society to serve the well-armed mounted nobles and - more often than not - die for them too.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_sassanid_2_2_description	Each Shahanshah was endowed with a 'farr' upon his inauguration. Following from the myth of Jamshid, the farr represented not only his right to rule, but also a warning that he should remain on the true path of righteousness.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_sassanid_3_2_description	The Sassanids were not ones to let religious differences interfere with good diplomatic relations and business. Yazdegerd I openly favoured Christianity, even persecuting the Magi who had sworn enmity against Christians.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_sassanid_4_2_description	Coins minted under Bahram V have been found all over the known world, from Rome to China and almost everywhere in between. Minted all over the Sassanid Empire, they depict the head of the king himself within the holy flames of the fire-altar.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_faction_sassanid_5_2_description	After almost twenty years of peace between the two nations, Sassanid-Roman relations broke down.

mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_eastern_1_1_description	Fire was an important Zoroastrian symbol. As the head of the Sassanid Persian Empire, the Shahanshah - King of Kings - was given custody of the sacred flame. This was reflected in the design of coins minted at the time. The flame represented not just his right to rule, but also his official role as defender of the national faith.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_eastern_2_1_description	Although predominantly Zoroastrian, Christians were not an uncommon sight in Sassanid lands. Yazdegerd I, under the influence of Narutha, Bishop of Mesopotamia, declared tolerance of others' faiths. This mean that Christians were free to worship openly throughout the Sassanid Empire.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_eastern_3_1_description	As told in the tales of Arash, in the Shahnameh, eastern marksmanship was considered second to none. Sassanid archers were known to be fast, accurate, and deadly, and were often used to disrupt and harry enemy lines, softening them up for a devastating heavy cavalry charge.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_eastern_4_1_description	Conflict between Rome and the East was frequent. Triggered by Bahram V's persecution of the Christians, the Roman Emperor Theodosius II declared war on the Sassanid Empire after prompting by his influential sister, Pulcheria. In the event, this particular conflict lasted only two years before being settled with a 'white' peace - restoring the two powers' borders to their pre-war positions.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_eastern_5_1_description	In AD453, Yazdegerd II moved the Sassanid court to the far north of his empire, so it might be better defended against the Hunnic invaders. At the foot of Mount Binalud, he marshalled his forces and prepared to face scourge from the steppes.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_eastern_1_2_description	A large number of craftsmen lived and worked within the cities of Sassanid Persia. Organised into corporations or employed directly by the Shahanshah, these highly-skilled artisans, often Christians, were exempt from military service. Their presence greatly increased the rate of production for woodwork and ceramics. To keep this industry running, large quantities of natural resources were required.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_eastern_2_2_description	Before their military reforms, the Sassanids levied the vast majority of their army's infantry units. Kitted out with the bare minimum of equipment, and rarely trained beyond following pre-arranged commands, eastern levies were intended to be nothing more than "meat shields", designed to pin down enemy infantry just long enough for the deadly cataphracts and horse archers to do their work.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_eastern_3_2_description	The eastern empires relied heavily on trade with their neighbours. Straddling the divide between Europe and Asia, they were able to take advantage of their fortuitous geographical position, enjoying vast trade networks stretching from China and India across to the Mediterranean.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_eastern_4_2_description	Under the reign of Bahram V, the Sassanid Empire enjoyed great prosperity. In such an environment, culture flourished; books were written, music was composed and Polo became the sport du jour of royalty.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_eastern_5_2_description	Although there was much religious tolerance throughout Sassanid rule of the east, it was not always so accepting of other cultures and religions. Yazdegerd II was famed for his intolerance; Jews were unable to observe the Sabbath and Christians were forced to convert to Zoroastrianism, which led to a violent uprising in Armenia in AD451.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_eastern_2_3_description	Water in the east was scarce, so in a largely agrarian economy such as the Sassanid Empire access to water was an absolute priority. To achieve this in the arid and desert conditions, a range of 'qanats' - underground canals - were built across its territory.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_eastern_3_3_description	Although they predominantly horded across western Europe, the Huns also made several incursions southeastward. They waged war across Asia Minor and much of the east, almost toppling Ctesiphon - the Sassanid capital - itself before being repelled by Persian forces.	true
mission_text_text_att_objective_culture_eastern_5_3_description	According to the Haft Paikar, Bahram V married seven beautiful princesses from seven corners of the world. Each night he would visit one of his princesses in their own pavilion, which were coloured to represent the region where they came from, and where they would recount a tale to him.	true

mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_danes_1_4_description	There are few traces of the Vikings’ religion left in the archaeological record.

mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_danes_1_2_description	The clinker-built longship was fundamental to the Viking way of war.

mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_danes_1_3_description	Many have suggested that the age of Viking expansion had its roots in the conflict between Norse paganism and Christianity; Viking traders received less favourable rates than their Christian counterparts, while their country served as a refuge for Saxons displaced by Charlemagne’s zealous campaign of persecution. The shortage of both food and money this created could well have prompted the raiding of prominent Christian centres across Europe. 	true

mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_danes_1_1_description	The first report of a serious Viking raid in the British Isles occurred in AD793 at Lindisfarne, an Island monastery off the coast of Northumbria. The psychological impact of this event on the locals was severe, with contemporary accounts recording apocalyptic signs and portents in the skies. 	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_danes_2_1_description	The Obotrites, a Slavic people settled just below Danish territory, were a tempting proposition to the expansionist Vikings. Having thrown their lot in with Charlemagne, they were awarded former-Saxon territory in AD804. Wasting no time, the Vikings wrested back this land, sparking hostilities that lasted for centuries.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_danes_3_1_description	Charlemagne realised the destructive power of the Vikings early on and sought peace. Negotiations failed, however; King Godfred continued work on the Danevirke defences and in AD809 led large scale assaults on the north Frisian coast, eventually claiming the land as his own. 	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_danes_4_1_description	Unfortunately, the Vikings’ societal structure, built around the domination of lesser kings through military might, ultimately proved easy for Charlemagne to exploit. By setting the members of the Viking elite against each other with promises of gold, he was able to severely blunt their war machine. If, on the other hand, the Vikings had remained united, they may even have threatened the Frankish capital in time.	true
mission_text_text_cha_objective_faction_cha_danes_5_1_description	Though the Vikings initially landed on the east coast of England, it did not take them long to work their way around to Ireland. Here, the abundance of coastal settlements and lack of strong, centralised resistance made it a favoured raiding destination. Eventually, they settled there, founding several outposts that went on to become important cities.	true
