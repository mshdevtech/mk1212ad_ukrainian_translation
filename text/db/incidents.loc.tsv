incidents_localised_description_att_incident_religious_arian_emmigration_1	Belief in the Arian faith is spreading to neighbouring lands; people are converting in their droves.	true
incidents_localised_description_slav_incident_venedians_bonus	Lord, an opportunity has presented itself to us. Though the Huns have left us alone for now, they have desolated nearby regions. Rather than occupying the territory, they have stripped it down and burned everything before moving on. These territories, though in disarray, are now exposed. We could capture these lands for ourselves and revitalise them. The people will thank us, and our strength will grow as a result. Strike forth, my lord, and seize greatness!	true

incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_verden_failure	You may have cut the heathens down, but in doing so you have outraged the Saxon people. Your slights against their pagan gods and vile, heathen ways have led to open rebellion. You have insulted and worn away at the very bedrock of their lives, something they will no longer stand for.

incidents_localised_description_att_subject_domestic_roman_slave_murderer_i_C	The man's crimes soon come to light, as does your involvement. People mutter of your cowardice in the streets; your family's name will be forever tarnished.	true
incidents_localised_description_att_subject_domestic_roman_slave_murderer_i_B	The man is put to death for his crimes. All praise your decision to bring him to justice.	true
incidents_localised_description_att_subject_domestic_roman_slave_murderer_i_A	One of your men silences the freedman and disposes of his body. Unfortunately, the bloated corpse resurfaces in the river shortly afterwards. Although no one can directly connect you to the crime, rumours are soon flying…	true
incidents_localised_description_att_subject_domestic_roman_slave_murderer_i_D	The freedman leaves your home. Before long, rumours abound that the brothers of the murdered man have taken their revenge…	true
incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_rebels_ireland	The Irish people know their history is long and illustrious. For centuries they have ruled themselves – to live under another’s yoke is abhorrent to them. In response to your attempts to rule there, they have risen up to liberate the Emerald Isle once and for all.	true
incidents_localised_description_att_subject_religious_barb_stones_i_D	You send men to investigate the claims. When they arrive the earth has already ceased quaking, the stone warriors slumber, and all is well.	true

incidents_localised_description_att_subject_religious_barb_stones_i_A	The wise man lays his hands upon the stones and chants late into the night. When the sun rises the next day the stones are still standing. There is no sign of the dead warriors' spirits escaping from their stony prisons.	true

incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_rebels_croatia	Though they may have bent the knee when you first conquered them, the Slavs have declared that they will no longer be your thralls.

incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_rome_attacked	This is a dark day indeed! Rome has been attacked, the seat of the Papacy has once again suffered the blight of war; unsurprisingly, Christians across the lands are greatly upset at this turn of events.	true
incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_carloman_2_bankroll	Your money is often as good as any sword, and having paid the separatists in Carloman’s lands they have stuck to the terms of your agreement. They have used your funding to gather together all the men and weapons they could possibly muster and have risen up as one to take control of much of Carloman’s former territory. Having done so, they now swear fealty to you and have handed over the newly captured territory to you. You have managed to avoid a large conflict; by using cunning instead you have dramatically weakened Carloman’s remaining influence and have expanded your own borders at the same time. You must now decide whether to continue on and consolidate your power through model kingship or simply accept the outcome and turn your attentions elsewhere.	true
incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_seasonal_drought	Wells and irrigation channels have dried up in the hot weather. As a result, crops have failed and animals have starved. The ensuing food shortage is making people restless.	true

incidents_localised_description_att_subject_domestic_barb_nomad_hostile_dispute_i_A	You rebuke your son in the strongest possible terms, and send him away to lick his wounds. Word has quickly reached the rival tribe, who are placated by your action. However, your son's forgiveness will not come so swiftly...	true
incidents_localised_description_att_subject_domestic_barb_nomad_hostile_dispute_i_B	With your son gone, the people are much happier. They can get on in relative peace without the troublemaker causing more mischief. Your wife, on the other hand, feels differently about the matter…	true
incidents_localised_description_att_subject_domestic_barb_nomad_hostile_dispute_i_C	Reinforcing your son's impulsive behaviour has left a stain on your reputation. Your followers now trust you less, and rivals think you shallow and easy to manipulate.	true
incidents_localised_description_att_subject_domestic_barb_nomad_hostile_dispute_i_D	You have ignored your son's behaviour and relations with the other tribe have stabilised somewhat. However, who knows what he'll do next to get your attention?	true

incidents_localised_title_cha_incident_seasonal_trade_muslim	Trade Fair	true
incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_saxon_1	The push of Christianity is relentless, driven hard by the Frankish king, Charlemagne. Though the Saxons resist, there are those who have fallen into submission to his ‘True God’. Yet there are those who still resist, striking out at the king and his nobles in defiance of what they consider to be a false deity. The ire of Charlemagne, however, is great and furious. Those responsible for the attack on the king’s men have been rounded up and held to ransom. Charlemagne’s instruction is clear – you will convert to Christianity, or die. The decision is yours alone, yet the outcome will be far-reaching.	true
incidents_localised_title_att_incident_setback_piracy	Piracy	true
incidents_localised_description_att_incident_disaster_drought_spreads	The drought continues. Water has become so scarce that it is now worth more than gold! Only the wealthy have been spared this privation.	true

incidents_localised_description_slav_incident_sclaveneans_1	The world is being ravaged. From the northeast, the fast-approaching Huns pillage and burn everything before them. It is only a matter of time before they are upon us as well, yet the Sclaveni do not bow before any would-be conqueror, and certainly not these marauding Huns. When they come, and they will most certainly come, we will push them back to the steppes they came from. No mercy. No surrender!	true
incidents_localised_description_att_political_action_generic_followup_devotion_male	This man is grateful for your aid during a recent political intrigue.	true

incidents_localised_description_att_eos_incident_religious_event_rebellion_att_fact_axum_att_rel_church_east	In response to your refusal, fanatics have taken up arms against your kingdom! They seek to topple your throne and remake the kingdom under their rule. Your response must be swift and absolute, you have made your decision - once and for all - and your dedication will be repaid as you supress this heresy.	true
incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_rebels_denmark	The Vikings are fierce and proud, and despite your subjugation have not forgotten the Old Ways, nor the Old Gods. Your attempts to crush their beliefs have made them rise up against you. Their heresy is noble, but is heresy all the same, and must be eradicated.\\nThese armies will spread their heretical paganism until they are destroyed.	true
incidents_localised_description_att_political_action_incident_become_retainer_failure	Some have little time for hangers on. This man's requests to become his superior's retainer were dismissed out of hand.	true
incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_carloman_2_alliance	He may be just a young boy now, but one day Carloman’s son will become a man, and a king. The goodwill you, as his uncle, have built today will forever stand as a testament to the strong relationship between Franks, one capable of transcending bloodlines and echoing down the ages. Surely together you can overcome all opponents? If so, all of Europe will stand in the shadow of the Franks - two kingdoms bound together and acting as one. When opportunity presented itself you put family and honour first, proving yourself to be a man willing to put his family over personal glory, and surely one to be truly feared and respected.	true
incidents_localised_description_att_incident_religious_tengri_emmigration_1	Belief in the Tengrist faith is spreading to neighbouring lands; people are converting in their droves.	true
incidents_localised_description_slav_incident_venedians_2_2	Although refusing the Hun’s overbearing demands is noble and brave, the ire of the horde is almost certain to follow. Even now, their malignant gaze turns towards us for our defiance. We should prepare ourselves accordingly, as it can be safely assumed that the Huns do not bear a slight without retribution.	true
incidents_localised_description_slav_incident_venedians_2_1	The Huns have left, satisfied with what they have collected, and endeared towards our people for our resilience and willingness to treat with them. Hunnic favour is a rare and valuable commodity in these trying times. Yet it is doubtless that they will return, but the time we have bought ourselves in quenching their thirst can be used to better prepare for their inevitable return.	true
incidents_localised_description_att_subject_religious_zoroastrian_corpse_i_D	The family of the man see to it that the body is properly prepared for death. The man is taken to his brother's house to be cared for.	true

incidents_localised_description_att_subject_religious_zoroastrian_corpse_i_C	The man's neighbours soon hear of what he has done and are outraged that you have allowed such behaviour. Word spreads quickly; there are dark mutterings in the streets.	true
incidents_localised_description_att_subject_religious_manichaeism_pilgrims_1_SECOND	The Bema Fest is banned, and the followers of Mani are prevented from congregating in public.	true
incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_rebels_saxony	The Saxon people are tired of being trampled, tired of this repression of the Old Ways by the so-called True Religion. In the forests they gather, and mutter of uprising. They have drawn a line in the dirt; they will fight in the name of the Old Gods again, rising with fury against your rule. This barbaric, heretical insurgence must be put down.\\nThese armies will spread heretical paganism until they are destroyed.	true

incidents_localised_description_att_bel_request_justinian_photius_response_1	It is said that “a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh”. I know how hard it is to defy a woman who has for so many years been as your own body.\\n\\nHowever, now I can offer you a new bride to guard and protect - the restored Empire! You have proved your loyalty beyond all question and, in my estimation, none are above you. Dedicate yourself to my cause anew, and you will realise that the unpleasantness with your wife is in fact your greatest gain.	true
incidents_localised_description_att_bel_request_justinian_photius_response_2	For years I have considered you my partner, but now I discover that all along you have been the slave of another. When a wife’s grasp overwhelms a man’s devotion to his sovereign he becomes useless to all – a hindrance and a stumbling block to the nation as a whole.\\n\\nI wash my hands of you. Run back to your wife and live out your days under her tyranny.	true

incidents_localised_description_att_bel_request_antoninia_ioannina_1	Oh my husband, she has finally done it! That crazy old witch in the palace has finally gone too far! I don’t care about her interfering, making me run around doing her dirty work, but what she did to our dear sweet daughter… oh it’s killing me.\\n\\nTheodosia, that wrinkled hoarder, decided it was time she got her hands on our fortune and proposed her rancid nephew Anastasius as a match for dear Ioannina. Annia always hated the freckly imp so of course I said no, I don’t want her getting her claws any further into our family… Do you know what she did?\\n\\nShe made him bed her!\\n\\nOur only daughter, taken under the roof of our friend and benefactor. Of course now the poor girl thinks she loves him! She wants to marry him now and Theodosia has got exactly what she wants.\\n\\nStop her husband! Do something - do anything.

incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_pope_attacked_3_success	With appropriate dignity and import you arrive in Roma. Under your careful eye, Leo submits to the Oath of Purgation, proving his innocence once and for all in a flawless performance. Restored to his position, Pope Leo sees harmony restored to Roma and the instigators of his ideal exiled from its walls. For you, this happy resolution is reward enough, and you prepare to leave the capital as soon as the Christmas celebrations are over. However, as you kneel before the Pope at mass, he places a crown on your head and declares you Imperator Romanorum – Emperor of the Romans! In one moment, he disinherits the weak leaders of the Eastern dregs and declares you the head of the world’s greatest empire. Only you have the power to protect, nurture and restore its former glory.

There is but one way to prove yourself, and that is by showing you are powerful, and worthy of their service. If measures are not taken to curb these seditious thoughts about your leadership, the people will grow restless and unhappy, and your warriors may defy commands to fight in your name.

Refugees spread across the globe, bringing their pestilence with them.\\n\\nMany see it as further evidence of the much-prophesised end of days - burning wrath poured from the chalice of God’s judgement - and demand that the correct obeisance is duly paid.\\n\\nOther, more practical minds demand alternative solutions. Dramatic improvements in sanitation and the end of trade with infected nations may stem or even stop the disease in its tracks.	true

The thing is Belli, and it really pains me to admit it, but Photius is a nasty boy. I don’t know how he turned out so crooked after the example we set for him, but he’s both twisted and manipulative. He told the most scandalous lies about the other children just to make sure he was my favourite…\\n\\nNow, I know you are much smarter than me, but if he tries telling you lies, you won’t believe them will you? It’s only, well, he was angry at me for not increasing his allowance, and now I’m worried he might try and hurt me. I know there are horrible rumours going around about me and Theo, and I’m worried he may try to stir them up. If he does, will you promise to make sure you deal with him very firmly?

incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_carloman_1_death	Your brother and fellow Frankish king, Carloman, has died. Now, his kingdom is in turmoil; his wife Gerberga has manoeuvred their eldest son, Pepin, onto the throne. Although he is still a boy, those loyal to Carloman support his succession and are willing to fight for his cause. There are, however, some among his generals who seek to unite all the Franks under a single monarch. Disillusioned by what they perceive as Carloman’s poor leadership, they would undoubtedly support you as the true claimant to his lands, should you wish it. However, if you prefer to seek a purely military resolution to this matter, you should expect all those who do not support you to rally to a single banner at the capital. Perhaps this will be a chance for you to deal a single decisive blow? You must soon decide your course of action…	true

incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_pope_help_2_2	After careful consideration, you decide that protecting your relationship with the powerful Lombard Kingdom is the priority. Your repudiation of Princess Desiderata has already brought strain to what may have been a promising alliance, and you do not wish to test if further. As a result, the Pope is bitterly disappointed and your relations will undoubtedly suffer. The Lombards aggressive policy of expansion may now engulf the Papal States altogether. However, the influence of the Papacy has been waning for many years, so their disfavour is a small price to pay for goodwill with Desiderius. Having taken the first steps to reconciliation, it would be wise to seek a close relationship with the Lombards at every opportunity. Together you could wield a power unmatched in Europe, and perhaps the world!	true

Fortunately, almighty God, in his benevolence, gave Leo the strength to succeed and so his office has been restored.

incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_carloman_2_war	The time has come! After hearing of your intentions, those still loyal to Carloman’s court have acted decisively, as was to be expected. They have seized control wherever they can, though their grip on power is extremely tenuous. They currently hold the seat of power at Carloman’s capital, where their most loyal troops are stationed and are proclaiming a new ruler of these lands. While many seem to have accepted this, it is nothing more than treason. Seize your chance to end resistance to your rightful inheritance! Assault the capital with all your might, defeat the loyalists holding the region and there will no longer be any doubts regarding your righteous ascension.

After the admirable way you handled this you may take deserved pleasure in your daughter’s newlywed bliss and the warm affection of both the Emperor and myself. I understand that your wife still harbours resentment of the union, and I apologize if you have incurred her displeasure in blessing it. It is hard for mothers to see their children leave the household, and your wife is a woman who likes to remain in control.\\n\\nBy defying her you have set a valuable precedent.

incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_lombard_pope_demands_2_4	Somewhat surprisingly, standing your ground on this matter has led to the full support of the Frankish king. Knowing that you have no intention of relenting, it would appear that Charlemagne has been deterred by the prospect of open conflict with you merely to secure Papal interests. As such, he has spoken to the Pope and expressed that he should use some perspective in this case and that continuing to press old claims will lead to war in Italy. Reluctantly, the Pope has agreed and relinquished his claims on Ravenna. Subjects across your kingdom have been inspired by your strength of will; to stand firm when faced with the combined might of the Papal States and the Franks is no small feat.	true
incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_lombard_pope_demands_2_3	Your plan has worked; the numerous compliments and public proclamations of the Frankish king’s might have convinced Charlemagne to side with you in this matter. He has refused to back the Papal States militarily and counselled that the wisest course of action would be to give up Papal claims on Ravenna. The Pope has reluctantly agreed – something of a diplomatic victory for the Lombards. However, now your subjects consider you half the man Charlemagne supposedly is; you have kept Ravenna under Lombard control, but at what cost to your own throne?	true
incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_lombard_pope_demands_2_2	The Pope, perhaps not completely convinced of the likelihood of Charlemagne’s support - or perhaps just utterly swayed by the promise of increased wealth - has accepted your terms and relinquished his claim on Ravenna.	true
incidents_localised_description_cha_incident_lombard_pope_demands_2_1	The Pope’s attempts to influence your actions by calling for Charlemagne’s support seem to have worked; you have backed down and ceded the land.

incidents_localised_description_att_eos_incident_axum_mission_3	Hail oh king, slayer of Persians and sovereign of salubrious spices! As I predicted, the world kneels before us, begging for a whiff of saffron or a morsel of cinnamon. But even as the wretches grovel with one hand, with the other they try to pick our pockets! Their control of currencies allows them to determine the value of commodities, and naturally they do so to our detriment. I am by no means a poor man, but even I begin to wonder how I will put food in the mouths of my children! We need to place ourselves on an even footing by seizing a source of gold and minting coins in the manner of our forefathers. Thus we would regain control of our own markets and drastically increase the profitability of our trading enterprises. It is our great fortune to have a sovereign whose visage would adorn a coin most majestically…	true
incidents_localised_description_att_eos_incident_axum_mission_2	My heartiest congratulations, lord! Breathe and taste the pungent tang of the spice piled high on our docks! And those new men - their khandas will spill enough blood to slake even the thirst of the parched sands, mark my words. But we cannot rest on our laurels, my lord, oh no! Even with our new supplies, demand from the west still outstrips our means. The remaining two spice ports lie in the shadow of a great lion – the Sassanids do not like to see prize land snatched from under their noses – but nothing of value comes with ease (bar your winning charm, highness)… and think of the rewards! As the only supplier of spice, we could hold the whole world to ransom - and with yet more troops armed with Gupta weapons, who would be able to challenge us?	true
incidents_localised_description_att_eos_incident_axum_mission_1	Some say that variety is the spice of life, my lord, but I say that the spice of life is yet more spice! Many times I have made the treacherous journey to the east, bounded by the scorched desert and the barren sea, in search of the red sand that has made our kingdom wealthy. There too I have seen wonders that would greatly interest your highness – weapons so sharp that your eyes bleed at the sight, bows made of steel that spit arrows like thunder from the heavens, and mounts swifter than a monsoon hurricane. But our ships are too few and competition has emerged. If your mightiness in all his temperate wisdom would consider sending an expedition to seize just one rival spice port, I could promise soldiers and riches beyond your wildest imaginings!	true

Build new structures that will please our god, or convert these new heretical buildings, and we will reimburse you generously indeed. Not only that, but we will also go amongst the populace giving alms and praising your great leadership. Thus any resentment you incur during the conversion will be nullified.

We will restore the Empire; we will put an eternal end to the crowing of barbarian usurpers and, setting aside our lands as inviolate, earn the title “Last of the Romans”.\\n\\nBut the road to glory is steep, Belisarius, and both our burdens heavy. I must add another to your shoulders now, although I am confident you can carry it. For some time I have been cultivating a relationship with the widowed Ostrogoth queen, Amalasuntha. She is an excellent woman, and very receptive to my goals of restoring Roman rule to her lands. Alas her cruel brother caught wind of our communication and has deposed and imprisoned her. I cannot stress how important her release is for our enterprise. I authorise the use of whatever force you see fit, cut down half of her kingdom if you must, but restore her freedom!	true
