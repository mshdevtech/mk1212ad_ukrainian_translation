vo_fmv_texts_text_mk1212_crusades_intro	The Holy Bible may preach peace, but when it is Christendom itself that is threatened,  |then it is every Christian's duty to defend all that is holy.  |His Holiness the Pope has called a crusade to reclaim the holy lands from the infidel,  |who would deny Christian pilgrims their right to visit the holy places.  |It is time for the armies of Christendom to put aside their differences and unite under one banner:  |the sign of the cross,  |and give back God's children what is rightfully theirs...  |...or die trying.  	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_mk1212_faction_intro_byz	We are the mere shadow of an empire that once ruled all, left behind in the dust as the world around us moves on and forgets our civilized ways.  |The legacy we built - crumbles before us, as our homeland is conquered by the lords of the west.  |While our capital is ransacked by Crusaders, the Turks close in from the east. We are threatened on all sides, yet there is still hope...  |...for we are Romans.  |We are a proud people, with victory and triumph running through our veins.  |We are resilient, having overcome greater challenges in the past.  |We are the remnants of the greatest empire the world has ever seen.  |And we will fight with the strength of our ancestors to take back what is rightfully ours.  |We are destined to restore our mighty empire, and rule the world once more!	true
