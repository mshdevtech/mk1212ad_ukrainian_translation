start_pos_factions_long_description_2120156889	Після понад століття втрат і поразок, що завершилися розпадом неспокійної Західної Римської імперії та втратою самого Риму, Східна імперія переживає період зростання. Юстиніан I — «Великий» для своїх численних шанувальників і людина, відома своїми великими амбіціями, — розпочав політику, відому як «Renovatio Imperii». Буквально «Відновлення Імперії», її метою є змінити долю Риму на краще шляхом комплексного перегляду статутів та законів Імперії, масштабної програми будівництва в Константинополі та, що найамбітніше, відновлення Західної Імперії з рук варварів.\\n\\nПівнічна Африка майже сто років перебувала під контролем вандалів, які мігрували на південь через Іспанію. Так само Італійський півострів був втрачений Імперією після того, як останній західний імператор Ромул Августул зрікся престолу, що спричинило низку катастрофічних подій, які завершилися створенням Остготського королівства під владою короля Теодоріха. Саме в таку ситуацію потрапив римський генерал Белісарій, завданням якого було відвоювати всі колишні території Імперії.\\n\\nЗ тих пір, як він вирвав перемогу з рук поразки в битві при Дарі, де застосував нетрадиційну і геніальну тактику, щоб нейтралізувати персів, незважаючи на значну чисельну перевагу супротивника, репутація Белісарія була незаперечною. Як найвищий за рангом офіцер у Константинополі, він командував імперськими військами, коли в столиці спалахнули заворушення Ніка, залишаючись непохитним і жорстоко придушивши повстання. Тепер Юстиніан знову звернувся до свого найнадійнішого генерала з не менш важливим завданням, ніж повне відвоювання Заходу!\\n\\n Немає кращого часу — вандали перебувають у політичній кризі, їхнє королівство охоплене повстаннями, а остготи стикаються з династичною кризою, яка значно послаблює їхнє становище. Белісарій — людина, яка може скористатися цією слабкістю, і єдиний, хто може повернути славу розбурханій Римській імперії — імперії, яка занадто довго перебувала в тіні свого минулого!	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120157887	З давніх-давен землі Нижнього Дунаю були місцем міграцій та вторгнень. З часу приходу готів у III столітті ніхто не міг назвати цю землю своєю, оскільки хвилі мігрантів накривали береги дунайського кордону і витісняли попередніх мешканців, які, у свою чергу, були витіснені новими прибульцями. Але один наполегливий народ витримав. Волохи оселилися в гірських районах Південних Карпат і на південь від Дунаю, звідки вони мігрували в сусідні землі в пошуках пасовищ і торгівлі. Коли брати Асен повстали проти Римської імперії, волохи приєдналися до повстанців і допомогли відновити Болгарську імперію. Під владою болгарського царя волохи насолоджувалися періодом відносного миру, що дозволило їм розвиватися і процвітати. Однак після Четвертого хрестового походу цар звернув свою увагу на південь. У той же час угорські королі прагнуть розширити свої кордони і заручилися підтримкою Тевтонського ордену, а на сході войовничі половці зміцнюють свою владу і збільшують частоту своїх жорстоких набігів. У той час як болгари переслідують свої імперські амбіції, волохи об'єднуються і шукають лідера серед воєвод. Затиснуті між великими державами, але підкріплені своїм досвідом у Повстанні, Волохи готові боротися зі своїми сусідами за контроль над землями за Дунаєм. Потрібне майстерне керівництво могутнього воєводи, щоб привести народ Волохів до незалежності і далі. -Роберік	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120158887	Смерть великого Жупана стала шоком для Великого князівства. Це викликало у людей занепокоєння щодо того, що буде далі, особливо з огляду на те, що Неманья вирішив передати трон своєму середньому синові Стефану, а не старшому, Вукану. Країна поринула у вир громадянської війни, і хоча спочатку Стефан зазнав поразки, він відвоював трон у свого старшого брата за допомогою болгар. Однак це мало значення для відносин із східним сусідом Сербії. Барабани війни гримлять між запеклими супротивниками, і великі купи трупів не завадили Сербії розпочати ще одну війну, цього разу за верховенство на півострові. Молодий Стефан амбітний, справді більше, ніж будь-який інший жупан до нього, можливо, навіть більше, ніж сам Неманья. Стефан сподівається нарешті перемогти запеклого супротивника Сербії на сході і, що ще важливіше, перетворити Сербію на справжнє королівство. Для цього йому потрібна підтримка сильного релігійного лідера. Однак східна церква, здається, не готова до цього, візантійська церква заважає сербам здобути патріархальну владу, а сама Візантія зупинила поширення Сербії на південь. Ще може бути можливість отримати корону від католицького папи, який прагне здобути вплив на Балканах після розколу між латинською та православною церквою понад століття тому. Жупан страждає від дрібних суперечок між сербськими вельможами, які вже поколіннями роздирають країну. Вельможі лояльні, поки болгарський лев реве на заході, але це єдине, що тримає їх разом. Найбільшим викликом для молодого Жупана буде не перемога над своїм запеклим суперником, а утримання бунтівної і нелояльної аристократії в підпорядкуванні своєму народу і під своїм контролем. Якщо Жупан досягне успіху, доля Сербії правити Балканами стане ще ближчою. -Алекса Шукович	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120157486	Історія Монгольської імперії фактично починається і закінчується з Чингісханом. Монгольські племена, які раніше були підданими Великого Ляо, розпалися на кілька конфедерацій після того, як Ляо впало під натиском зростаючої сили чжурчженів. Темуджин, монгол благородного походження, мав важке дитинство, включаючи вбивство його батька, його полонення і поневолення, перш ніж він виріс у великого лідера. Завдяки силі волі та великій хитрості Темуджин маневрував у племінній політиці і зумів здобути значну владу серед монгольських племен. Його найбільший союзник, давній друг і наставник Тогрул, Онг з конфедерації Кераїтів, найвпливовішої сили серед монголів, зрадив його, як і його кровний брат Джамуха, що призвело до прямого і кривавого протистояння, в результаті якого Темуджин став домінуючим правителем монгольських племен. Завершивши об'єднання монгольських племен, Чингісхан потім обернувся проти держав на півдні, знищивши Західну Ся, перш ніж вступити у війну проти могутньої династії Цзінь, династії чжурчженів, що правила Північним Китаєм. У 1211 році він завдав першої великої поразки Цзінь, і тепер двері для завоювання Китаю були відкриті. Однак принц найманів Кучлуг набирав силу серед кара-хітаїв, і неминуче погляд Чингісхана звернувся до Центральної Азії, де він сподівався покінчити зі своїм суперником і покласти край загрозі хітаїв. Така кампанія неминуче приведе монгольські війська до кордонів імперії Хорезм і Кумано-Кипчакської конфедерації. Його сини, Джочі, Чагатай, Огедей і Толуй, всі прагнуть скористатися перевагою, щоб створити власні володіння, коли монгольська орда захоплює багаті землі, що оточують степи.	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120158786	Протягом століть бербери Зената Бану Марін населяли територію Магребу, займаючись переважно напівкочовим скотарством, щоб вижити в суворому пустельному кліматі. Спочатку вони населяли регіон навколо міста Біскра (сучасний Алжир), але регулярно мігрували між оазами, щоб випасати свої стада домашніх тварин, часто пересуваючись між Сіджилмасою, Фігігом і річкою Мулуя (сучасне Марокко). На початку 13 століття, через прибуття арабських племен у цей район, вони масово мігрували вглиб земель сучасного Марокко, де їхнім могутнім володарем був халіфат Альмохадів. Як вірні піддані імперії, Бану Марін служили разом з арміями халіфа Альмохадів, зокрема під час вражаючої перемоги халіфа Абу Юсуфа Якуба аль-Мансура над армією короля Кастилії Альфонсо VIII у битві при Аларкосі в 1195 році, де Абу Джаліл Махю ібн Абі Бакр, вождь Бану Марін, загинув, командуючи добровольцями Бану Марін, які воювали в авангарді армії халіфа. Оскільки запеклий король Кастилії знову протистоїть Альмохадам, намагаючись реалізувати свої експансіоністські амбіції щодо Аль-Андалусу, Бану Марін будуть пильно стежити за халіфатом у міру розвитку подій. Якщо трапиться нагода, Бану Марін, можливо, зможуть створити власну спадщину, як господарі, а не піддані... - Суп з Кана	true
start_pos_factions_description_2120158585	The story of the Mongol empire effectively begins and ends with Genghis Khan. Formerly subjects of the Great Liao, the Mongol tribes fractured into a number of confederations once the Liao fell to the rising power of the Jurchen. Temujin, a Mongol of noble blood, led a difficult childhood, including the murder of his father and his capture and enslavement, before he grew into a great leader. Through sheer force of will and great cunning, Temujin maneuvered through tribal politics and managed to gain significant power amongst the Mongol tribes. His greatest ally, and a longtime friend and mentor, Toghrul, Ong of the Keraite confederation, the most significant power amongst the Mongols, turned on him, as did his blood brother Jamukha, leading to a direct and bloody confrontation which left Temujin as the dominant ruler of the Mongol groups. After finishing the unification of the Mongol tribes, Genghis Khan then turned on the states to the South, sweeping aside the Western Xia before engaging in war against the mighty Jin dynasty, the Jurchen dynasty ruling Northern China. In 1211, he inflicted the first major defeat of the Jin and the doors now lay open for conquest in China. However, a Naiman prince, Kuchlug, has been gaining power amongst the Qara Khitai, and inevitably, Genghis Khan’s eyes turn towards Central Asia, where he hopes to finish off his rival and put the Khitai threat to rest. Such a campaign will inevitably bring Mongol armies to the doorstep of the Khwarazmian empire and of the Cuman-Kipchak confederacy. His sons, Jochi, Chagatai, Ögedei and Tolui, all look to take advantage to carve out their own appanage as the Mongol horde takes over the rich lands surrounding the steppes.	true

Однак коронація Філіпа II Августа ознаменувала докорінну зміну в становищі королівства. Амбіції та талант Філіпа до правління призвели до піднесення Франції як домінуючої сили. Прагматична дипломатія призвела до майже повного завоювання континентальних володінь анжуйських королів Англії, а реформи дозволили більшу централізацію влади в королівстві. На початку 13 століття, коли його головні суперники — Анжуйське королівство Англії та Священна Римська імперія — були охоплені внутрішніми заворушеннями, король Франції мав чудові можливості заявити про себе як про домінуючого монарха в Західній Європі.	true

Генуя жорстко конкурує з багатьма іншими містами-державами, зокрема з сусідньою Пізанською республікою. Розпад візантійської торговельної мережі, спричинений Четвертим хрестовим походом під проводом Венеції, зруйнував статус-кво, і тепер, щоб отримати доступ до прибуткової торгівлі за межами Чорного моря, необхідно кинути виклик венеціанській перевазі. Генуя давно є ключовим союзником гвельфів і Папи Римського, а на її прапорах зображено символ гвельфів — хрест. Заможні купецькі родини воюють між собою, а Венеція також прагне скористатися здобиччю, яку вона забрала з колишньої візантійської столиці. Республіка все ще перебуває в залежності від імператора Священної Римської імперії і має зробити багато кроків, щоб звільнитися від його ярма. Багато хто в християнському світі також не схвалює дії Генуї, оскільки не розуміє прагнення до багатства, особистого і громадського. З патриціанськими родинами треба поводитися обережно, оскільки влада належить кожній з них, і вони прагнуть насамперед слави та багатства. Однак, якщо Генуя хоче протистояти всій могутності венеціанської торговельної імперії, вона повинна швидко завдати смертельного удару занепадаючій Пізанській республіці, і тоді Західне Середземномор'я належатиме генуезцям. -Військовий	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120157682	Альфонсо VIII, король Кастилії, за останні десятиліття здійснив значні політичні та військові кроки. Після відновлення втрачених територій Королівства Наварра та окупації земель Королівства Леон, він привів Кастилію до епохи переваги над іншими католицькими королівствами на півострові. Нещодавно йому вдалося укласти міцні договори та союзи з Леоном і Наваррою, що дозволило йому вирушити на південь проти Альмохадів. Армія зіткнулася з могутньою силою халіфа Альмохадів в Аларкосі, і брак терпіння та стратегії призвели до катастрофічних результатів, оскільки підкріплення наваррців та леонців вже було в дорозі. Зухвалий штурм піхоти під його командуванням призвів до оточення та повного знищення кастильських військ. Прорахунок дорого коштував Кастилії престижу та території. З новими зусиллями старий король зумів знову об'єднати католицькі королівства. Йде 1212 рік, Іберійський півострів знову в стані війни, а Кастилія стоїть на чолі католицьких націй, які прагнуть об'єднати півострів під християнським правлінням. Папа відповів на прохання кастильського монарха і закликав до Святого хрестового походу, щоб раз і назавжди зламати владу Альмохадів. Ордени Сантьяго і Калатрави знову приєднуються до Королівства Кастилія разом з Королівствами Арагону і Наварри, а також деякими католицькими добровольцями з Франції та Португалії, утворюючи велику коаліцію. У Лас-Навас-де-Толоса велике вторгнення військ Альмохадів застає їх зненацька завдяки маневрам католицьких військ, і починається битва, від результату якої залежить доля Іберії. -Драко	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120157481	Розпад Великої Сельджукської імперії зробив іранський світ вразливим для завоювання. Витівки сельджуцького султана Санджара проти шаха Астіза швидко зіпсували відносини між ними, і вторгнення Кара-Хітаїв виявилося щасливою подією. Після поразки Санджара, Хорезм-шах зумів консолідувати владу в провінції. Однак вплив династії Ануштегінідів справді проявився лише за правління шаха Текіша (1172-1200). Амбітний правитель, він одружився з принцесою Канґлі, пов'язавши себе з турецькими племенами Хорезму і забезпечивши стабільний приплив робочої сили. Його завоювання принесли під його владу більшу частину іранського світу і поклали кінець династії іранських сельджуків. Ці конфлікти налаштували шаха і халіфа аль-Насіра один проти одного, що призвело до різних дипломатичних інцидентів, які підготували грунт для наступника Текіша. Ала ад-Дін Мухаммед II успадкував владу свого батька і продовжив ту ж експансіоністську політику. До 1212 року Хварезмське царство затьмарило своїх гуридських суперників і завершило завоювання Хорасану, скинуло ярмо Кара-Хітаїв і самостійно стояло на вершині іранського світу. За винятком серйозних невдач, династія Ануштегінідів, здається, готова розрахуватися з неспокійним халіфом і роздробленими гуридськими царствами.	true

Спочатку ця земля була населена бритськими піктами, але з 7 століття на півострів почали переселятися різні народи: брити на півдні, незабаром за ними — англи, гели на заході та вікінги на сході й півночі. У 843 році Кеннет Макальпін став першим королем Альби, а гели та пікти асимілювалися, утворивши сучасних шотландців. З того часу Шотландія розширилася, завоювавши королівство Стратклайд і контролюючи більшу частину північної половини острова. Однак протягом більшої частини пізнього Середньовіччя стан справ у Шотландії залежав від англійської держави на півдні. Хоча набіги на Англію з півночі були звичайною практикою з часів Римської імперії, починаючи з 1072 року, а потім знову в 1080 році, нормандські війська почали репресальні вторгнення в Шотландію через набіги і втручання короля Дункана III (відомого за п'єсою «Макбет»). Дункан був убитий у битві в 1093 році, а починаючи з 1124 року з Давидом I, сформувалася нова динаміка влади, в якій Шотландія стала ближчою до Англії та європейської культури в цілому. У 1174 році король Шотландії Вільям I був навіть змушений прийняти англійське панування в договорі Фалез — першому випадку англійського панування в Шотландії. Вона знову стала вільною лише в 1189 році, коли Річард Левове Серце продав Шотландію назад Вільяму I за 6600 фунтів стерлінгів. На початку 13 століття Шотландія перебуває в скрутному становищі. Її нещодавно здобута незалежність постійно перебувала під загрозою з боку англійців, які могли в будь-який момент рушити на північ і зміцнити свої володіння в Британії. У своєму віддаленому куточку Європи Шотландія була в безпеці, але вона була ізольована і мала мало союзників, до яких могла звернутися за допомогою, а її єдиним сусідом по суші був її головний суперник. Щоб досягти успіху, Шотландія повинна була вести важку боротьбу за встановлення гегемонії на Британських островах проти переважаючих англійських сил, а також стримувати експансіонізм скандинавів на півночі та заході. Якщо все це вдасться, Шотландія опиниться в безпечному становищі, щоб торгувати, розширюватися і стати важливим гравцем у міжнародній політиці. Якщо народ Шотландії досягне успіху в цьому, країна може перетворитися з віддаленого північного куточка Європи на центр Північного моря. - КімДжонНезвичайний	true

Коронований папою, єдиним імператором, що залишився в Західній Європі, Отто об'єднав італійські та німецькі землі в розлогі імперські володіння. Однак значна частина влади залишалася в руках вищої знаті, і вибори стали для кандидатів шляхом до імператорського трону. Папа коронував короля, щоб той міг стати імператором. Завдяки такій унікальній феодальній динаміці Священна Римська імперія стала заплутаною мережею привілеїв, владних відносин і кровної ворожнечі. Прагматизм необхідний для орієнтування в політичному ландшафті імперії, проте Отто IV поставив себе в найненадійніше становище. Член роду Вельфів, одного з найвпливовіших родів Німеччини, він завдячує своєю короною перемозі над Штауферами після смерті Філіпа Швабського. Його похід в Італію призвів до його відлучення від церкви, а його противники в імперії обрали антикороля, Фрідріха Штауфенського, вибір якого схвалив сам папа. Його зв'язки з англійським троном загрожують конфліктом із сусіднім королівством Франція, що, ймовірно, зробить його вразливим на багатьох фронтах. Щоб імператор досяг успіху, він повинен спочатку покласти край конфлікту зі Святим Престолом, припинити повстання Фрідріха, утихомирити західний фронт і консолідувати політичну владу на імперських землях. Небагато хто може подолати стільки випробувань, але спадщина Карла Великого все ще чекає на свого спадкоємця. Імператор може і повинен подбати про те, щоб Європа знову об'єдналася під єдиним кайзером. Це його свята місія!	true

Юстиніан I розпочав свою «Renovatio Imperii» — політику, спрямовану на зміну долі Риму та відновлення Західної імперії від вандалів, які майже сто років контролювали північну Африку, та остготів, які зараз правлять Італією. Саме в цю ситуацію втрутився римський генерал Белісарій — його завданням було відвоювати у варварів усі колишні імперські території. Немає кращого часу — вандали охоплені повстаннями, а остготи стикаються з династичною кризою, яка значно послаблює їхнє становище. Белісарій — людина, яка може скористатися цією слабкістю, і єдиний, хто може повернути славу розбурханій Римській імперії — імперії, яка занадто довго перебувала в тіні свого минулого!	true

Знищення Стародавньої Великої Болгарії руками хазар спричинило хвилю вигнання на північ, де вони побудували новий дім на злитті Волги та Ками. Перехід болгар в іслам ознаменував для них зовсім інший шлях, ніж у їхніх західних побратимів, і наблизив їх до набагато більшого світу за межами степів. Завдяки своєму вигідному розташуванню на важливій торговельній артерії, Болгар став жвавим мегаполісом, а болгари зберегли дуже сильний вплив на торгівлю хутром. Однак така перевага неминуче привертає увагу заздрісних суперників. Русь вже досить давно є каменем у боці Волзької Булгарії, і нещодавні військові успіхи великого князя Володимира вимагають негайної уваги та відповідної реакції. Доки відносини з половцями залишаються мирними, Русь є єдиною значною загрозою для Волзької Булгарії, і захист західного кордону, безсумнівно, забезпечить її виживання та процвітання.	true

Століття потому графство Едеса та князівство Антіохія занепадають на півночі. Єрусалимське королівство, справжня перлина Утремера, все ще залишається сильним, але зазнало нищівних ударів. Після успіху Першого хрестового походу найсильнішу підтримку надавали переважно купецькі родини, які прагнули отримати прибуток від багатих торгових шляхів зі Сходу. Християнська підтримка, хоча номінально переважала в Європі, не дала Єрусалиму тих людських ресурсів і поставок, які були необхідні для збереження його домінування. Невдалий Другий хрестовий похід залишив Утремер вразливим до екзистенційної загрози, об'єднаної держави сарацинів. Однак Атабег Нур ад-Дін був більше зацікавлений в об'єднанні свого народу, ніж у знищенні франків Святої Землі. Його смерть перевела його королівство в руки його протеже, Салаха ад-Діна з династії Айюбідів. Салах ад-Дін виявився ворогом, якого боявся Єрусалим, знищивши армію в Хаттіні і захопивши більшу частину узбережжя, перш ніж відвоювати сам Єрусалим, що стало великою перемогою сарацинів. Третій хрестовий похід став зіткненням гігантів, але закінчився патовою ситуацією, а четвертий хрестовий похід виявився катастрофічним. Проблеми, з якими сьогодні стикається Утремер, дуже схожі на ті, що існували з моменту народження королівства: нестача робочої сили, обмежена підтримка корінного населення, постійні придворні інтриги і, що найголовніше, недисципліновані барони. Військові ордени виявили себе безцінними союзниками, але те, що Єрусалимському королівству зараз потрібно більше, ніж будь-коли, - це армія з Європи, яка відвоює те, що по праву належить християнам, - саме Святе місто.

Зі своєї нової батьківщини вони протягом десятиліть здійснювали незліченні успішні набіги на Західну Європу, Італію та Візантійську імперію. З настанням нового тисячоліття вони були змушені відмовитися від кочового способу життя і осісти. У 1000 році н. е. Угорщина була заснована як феодальна держава Іштваном, нащадком Арпада. Він став першим католицьким королем Угорщини і сформував феодальну державу з кочових племен. Внутрішні конфлікти, релігійні повстання та вторгнення Священної Римської імперії, Візантійської імперії та різних кочових племен зі Сходу змусили молоде королівство швидко адаптуватися. Під правлінням монархів з династії Арпадів королівство не тільки вижило, але й зміцнилося та розширилося, а за правління Бели III Угорщина вступила в справжній Золотий вік наприкінці XII століття. Син Бели Андраш II успадкував сильну країну з великими амбіціями. Але колесо історії обертається. Священна Римська імперія та Захід перебувають у стані хаосу, одні королівства піднімуться, а інші неминуче впадуть, Візантійська імперія тремтить, на Півдні з'являються нові сили, а зі Сходу чутки про ще більшу бурю...

Група кочових скотарів з Хорезму, сельджуки, мігрували до Ірану і захопили його силою на чолі великої туркменської конфедерації. Після того, як Близький Схід був об'єднаний під сильним керівництвом сельджуків в Ірані, постійні набіги турецьких племен призвели до прямого конфлікту з римським імператором, чия армія зазнала поразки під Манцикертом у 1071 році, проклавши шлях для турецького завоювання Анатолії. Дотримуючись традиційного розподілу землі як апанажів турків, сельджуки Руму зміцнили свою владу в Анатолії, підвищивши свій престиж і чинячи тиск на сусідніх християн. Вбивство Малік-Шаха, султана Великих Сельджуків, в 1092 році виявилося сприятливою подією для султана Руму, оскільки хаос, що спалахнув, дав йому, як і багатьом іншим у розпадаючійся Великій Сельджуцькій державі, можливість створити власну незалежну державу, вільну від сельджуцької політики в Ірані. Свобода була недовгою, оскільки хрестоносці з-за моря прийшли на допомогу відродженій імперії під владою Комнінів і завдали кілька поразок. Тепер, після століття сутичок з римлянами, франками та грузинами, Сельджуцька держава знаходиться на межі як розпаду, так і величі. Внутрішня політика загрожує стабільності держави, оскільки передчасна смерть султана Кайкусрау в 1211 році проти значно ослаблених римлян поставила амбіції сельджуцьких принців один проти одного і поставила султана Кайкауса в дуже хитке становище. Однак римляни розсіяні і слабкі, а Європа відкрита для амбіцій будь-якого турка, який може об'єднати недисципліновані племена Анатолії.	true

Спочатку вони населяли регіон навколо міста Біскра (сучасний Алжир), але регулярно мігрували між оазами, щоб випасати свої стада домашніх тварин, часто пересуваючись між Сіджилмасою, Фігігом і річкою Мулуя (сучасне Марокко). На початку 13 століття, через прибуття арабських племен у цей район, вони масово мігрували вглиб земель сучасного Марокко, де їхнім могутнім володарем був халіфат Альмохадів. Як вірні піддані імперії, Бану Марін служили разом з арміями халіфа Альмохадів, зокрема під час вражаючої перемоги халіфа Абу Юсуфа Якуба аль-Мансура над армією короля Кастилії Альфонсо VIII у битві при Аларкосі в 1195 році, де Абу Джаліл Махю ібн Абі Бакр, вождь Бану Марін, загинув, командуючи добровольцями Бану Марін, які воювали в авангарді армії халіфа. Оскільки запеклий король Кастилії знову протистоїть Альмохадам, намагаючись реалізувати свої експансіоністські амбіції щодо Аль-Андалусу, Бану Марін будуть пильно стежити за халіфатом у міру розвитку подій.

Нова династія, яка повалила залишки Газневідського султанату, афганські Гуріди швидко стали домінуючою силою в східному регіоні Ірану. Однак її найбільшим досягненням було розбиття династій Раджпутів у Північній Індії, коли Муїз ад-Дін вирушив до Тараїну і розгромив набагато більші сили Раджпутів під командуванням Прітхвіраджа Чаухана. На короткий час імперія Гуридів простягалася від Хорасану до Бенгалії. Саме смерть брата Муїзз ад-Діна і співправителя Гіят ад-Діна спричинила прямий конфлікт між Муїзз ад-Діном і головним суперником Гуридів, Хорезм-Шахом Ала ад-Діном Мухаммадом II. Поразка від його рук відкинула Гурідів назад, а вбивство султана призвело до повного розпаду султанату. Хоча трон перейшов до племінника Муїзз ад-Діна, Гіят ад-Діна, влада насправді перебувала в руках його мамлюкських командирів, його так званих синів. Влада нового султана була узурпована, коли один із старших командирів, Тадж ад-Дін Йилдиз, захопив королівський трон у Газні. Ізольований і слабкий, султан не зміг стримати амбіції Хорезм-Шаха і втратив значну частину території, перш ніж був убитий у 1211 році. Його спадкоємець і син був вивезений до Хорезму, щоб бути утримуваним як заручник, а Тадж ад-Дін опинився на вершині ієрархії в Афганістані, борючись проти принців Гурідів та союзних мамлюцьких командирів. Прямою загрозою для його королівства є експансіоніст Ала ад-Дін Мухаммед, але йому також безпосередньо загрожують інші колишні командири, найголовніший з яких — наступник Айбака, так званий король Делі, Ільтутміш.	true

Після смерті свого номінального сюзерена Нура ад-Діна Салах ад-Дін взяв на себе завдання об'єднати розпадаючуся державу Зенгідів і очолити війну проти держав хрестоносців. Розгромний удар, завданий Єрусалимському королівству в Хаттіні в 1187 році, спонукав католицьку церкву до швидкої реакції — організації нового хрестового походу. Серйозна загроза виникла, коли до походу приєдналися не один, а три королі. Завдяки зусиллям Річарда Левове Серце, короля Англії, сили Аюбідів були відкинуті назад, перш ніж настала глуха ситуація, і безпека Аюбідської держави була забезпечена.

Серед них Київ став стратегічною цитаделлю на Дніпрі, пов'язаною з величезними торговельними мережами, що сягали Балтійського та Чорного морів. До кінця IX століття регіональні лідери почали консолідувати владу в тому, що стане відомим як Київська Русь. Один з таких лідерів, Олег, розширив свій вплив на південь і зробив Київ політичним центром зростаючої держави, захопивши місто близько 882 року нашої ери. Пізніше Олег очолив походи проти хозар і здійснив успішний набіг на Константинополь у 907 році нашої ери.\\n\n Після невдалої спроби реформувати слов'янське та норвезьке язичництво у своїй державі, Володимир Великий відправив послів до всіх великих релігійних центрів того часу, включаючи іслам, юдаїзм, православ'я та католицизм. Володимир відкинув іслам через заборону алкоголю, юдаїзм, бо вірив, що Бог покинув їх, оскільки святе місто Єрусалим не було в руках євреїв, а католицизм — через його похмурі обряди. Саме Константинополь і пишні обряди східного православ'я вразили Володимира і привели його до християнізації Київської Русі.\\n\n Саме за часів правління сина Володимира, Ярослава Мудрого, Київ досяг найбільшого розквіту і впливу, незважаючи на те, що йому довелося вести кровопролитну громадянську війну проти свого зведеного брата Святополка, якого підтримував його тесть Болеслав Хоробрий, князь і майбутній король Польщі. Ярослав був витіснений до Новгорода, але переміг свого зведеного брата в битві і до 1019 року закріпив за собою Київську Русь. Ярослав запровадив нові закони, а також побудував славнозвісний Софійський собор і знамениті Золоті ворота в фортеці Києва. Однак він розділив Київську Русь між своїми синами, сподіваючись уникнути громадянської війни, але це лише зробило її неминучою, і після його смерті громадянська війна спустошила королівство.\\n\n Хоча Київська Русь колись була наймогутнішим королівством на всій землі. Поляки, хазари і навіть могутні та шановані візантійці дивилися на північ із повагою до могутності Русі. Але все, що починається, має закінчитися, і те, що почалося за правління Володимира Великого, закінчилося зі смертю його сина Ярослава Мудрого в 1054 році. Поки вороги Київської Русі набирали сили, сини та брати Ярослава послаблювали королівство та його землі нескінченними війнами за престол. Тепер місто Київ стоїть ізольовано, а незалежні князі правлять кожний своїм містом.\\n\n На сході великі князі Чернігова і Володимира правлять своїми містами, а на півночі литовці, які колись платили данину Київській Русі, тепер створили своє власне королівство на землях, які колись займала Русь, і навіть неодноразово загрожували великому місту Новгороду. На сході половці, кіпчаки та волжські болгари завжди прагнуть розширити свої володіння. Однак нещодавно відбулися зміни: степові племена сходу стали побоюватися нової сили, що насувається зі сходу.

Buoyed by Venetian protection and the military might of the Crusaders, the Latin Empire managed to sweep the pockets of Byzantine resistance before them and firmly establish themselves in Thrace and Greece. However, the Empire found itself in mortal peril almost as soon as it was established. Its first Emperor, Baldwin of Flanders, was defeated and killed by the Bulgarian Tsar Kaloyan in 1205. Since then, his brother Henry has barely managed to keep the empire together in the face of threats from both Bulgaria and the rising power of Nicaea, whose emperor claims continuity from the old Byzantine Empire. Emperor Henry rules a state surrounded by enemies, wracked by internal conflicts and weak central authority, but the Latins are not done for; the Latin knights are universally feared, and the capital Constantinople is rich and well-fortified.

Initially inhabiting the region around the city of Biskra (present-day Algeria), they would migrate at regular intervals between oases to graze their herds of domesticated animals, moving frequently between Sijilmasa, Figuig and the Moulouya River (present-day Morocco). In the early 13th century, owing to the arrival of Arab tribes in the area, they migrated en-masse deeper into the lands of modern-day Morocco, with the Almohad Caliphate as their powerful overlord.As loyal subjects of the Empire, the Banu Marin had served alongside the armies of the Almohad Caliph, most notably during the stunning victory of Caliph Abu Yusuf Ya’qub al-Mansur over the army of King Alfonso VIII of Castille at the Battle of Alarcos in 1195, where Abu Jalil Mahyu ibn Abi Bakr, chief of the Banu Marin, died commanding the Banu Marin volunteers fighting at the vanguard of the Caliph’s army. With the bitter Castillian king once again confronting the Almohads in an attempt to realise his expansionist ambitions against Al-Andalus, the Banu Marin will maintain a watchful eye towards the Caliphate as subsequent events unfold; If the opportunity presents itself, the Banu Marin could perhaps forge a legacy of their own, as masters rather than subjects... - Soup of Can	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120158991	The Republic of Pisa had played a pivotal role in the previous Crusades and gained much wealth and power for their part. They had gain very lucrative holdings in the East and their contributions to the cause of Christendom were undeniable. The Pope had granted them the valuable islands of Corsica and Sardinia in gratitude. They defeated Genoa on the seas and it was their naval laws that shaped the naval world. They had the respect of Popes and Emperors alike and it was once said that the Pisans were greatest naval ally of the Byzantines, even greater than Venice. But at the turn of the century, things have taken a turn for the worse. The Crusader States’ power slowly fades, and with them Pisa's holdings. The Byzantine Empire is broken thanks to Venetian meddling and Pisa finds itself set upon by its major rivals. The greatest battles for Pisa are yet to come. If Pisa is to survive, it must reassert its dominance and explore far and wide for the next financial boon before its rivals carve up what remains amongst themselves. -Warman	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120158090	The Swiss was split for most of the early middle ages between the two Kingdoms of Lotharingia and East Francia. After the assimilation of the Lotharingia into East Francia, now known as the Holy Roman Empire, the Swiss territory was finally reunited in the 11th century. Throughout the 11th to 12th centuries, the Swiss plateau was the dominion of several houses such as the Habsburgs, the Savoy, Zähringen and Kyburg. Under the Hohenstaufen dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire, many of the notable communes of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, (collectively known as the Waldstatten [forest communities]), Bern and Zürich gained the Reichsfreiheit or Imperial Immediacy. This put the Swiss into a unique position of independence within the Holy Roman Empire, allowing a union of rural and urban communes to form within the isolated mountainous region. Moreover, her position over the Alps offers strategic importance as the passes of Raetia and St. Gotthard provides the only direct route between the German and Italian halves of the Empire. This however, might beckon unwanted influences from some great houses of the Empire which covet the land, desiring the land for themselves...	true

A group of nomadic pastoralists from Khwarazm, the Seljuk migrated into Iran and took it by force at the head of a large Turkmen confederation. Once the Near East had been consolidated under strong Seljuk leadership in Iran, the perennial raids from the Turkish tribesmen led to direct conflict with the Roman emperor, whose army fell at Manzikert in 1071, paving the way for Turkish conquest in Anatolia. Following the traditional assignment of land as apanages of the Turks, the Seljuks of Rum consolidated power in Anatolia, increasing their prestige and pressing the neighbouring Christians. The assassination of Malik-Shah, Sultan of the Great Seljuks, in 1092 proved to be an opportune event for the Sultan of Rum, as the chaos that erupted gave him, like many in the disintegrating Great Seljuk realm, the opportunity to carve out their own independent realm, free from Seljuk politics in Iran. The freedom was short-lived, as Crusaders from beyond the sea to help the resurgent empire under the Komnenoi and inflicted several setbacks. Now after a century of back and forth with the Romans, Franks and Georgians, the Seljuk realm is firmly on the edge of both collapse and greatness. Internal politics threatens the very stability of the realm as the untimely death of Sultan Kaikusrau against the greatly weakened Romans in 1211 has pitted the ambitions of the Seljuk princes against each other and thrust Sultan Kaikaus in a very fragile situation. However, the Romans are scattered and weak, and Europe stands open to the ambitions of any Turk who can unite the unruly tribes of Anatolia.	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120158599	The collapse of the Great Seljuk empire has left the Iranian world ripe for the taking. Seljuk Sultan Sanjar's antics against Shah Astiz quickly soured the relation between both, and the Qara-Khitai invasion proved to be a fortuitous event. With Sanjar defeated, the Khwarazm-Shah managed to consolidate power in the province. However, the impact of the Anushteginid dynasty only truly came about during the reign of Shah Tekish (1172-1200). An ambitious ruler, he married a Qangli princess, tying himself to the Turkish tribes of Khwarazm and ensuring a steady stream of manpower. His conquests brought much of the Iranian world under his rule and ended the dynasty of the Iranian Seljuks. These conflicts turned the Shah and the Caliph al-Nasir against one another, leading to various diplomatic incidents which would set the table for Tekish's successor. Ala ad-Din Muhammad II succeeded his father and pursued the same expansionist policies. By 1212, the Khwarazmian realm has now eclipsed their Ghurid rivals and finished the conquest of Khorasan, cast off the Qara-Khitai yoke and stands alone at the top of the Iranian world. Barring a major setback, the Anushteginid dynasty appears set to settle its scores with the troublesome Caliph and the fractioned Ghurid kingdoms.	true

start_pos_factions_long_description_2120157036	Charlemagne is king of the Franks; he has fought both friend and foe alike to make that so. The kingdom he has inherited, on the cusp of greatness, is due to the work of his forebears - the progenitors of Carolingian ascendancy.\\n\\nCharlemagne's grandfather, Charles Martel, was a powerful mayor of the palace of Austrasia under the last Merovingian kings - and effectively regent to their weak, indolent rule. Having led the Franks to victory at the Battle of Tours in AD732, he halted the seemingly endless Muslim advance and relegating their activities to Iberia. This victory established Carolingian power within the Frankish Kingdom, further diminishing the rule of the failing Merovingians. Charles' son, and Charlemagne's father, Pepin, ultimately deposed the final Merovingian king, Childeric III, and was crowned the first of the Carolingian monarchs with the consent of Pope Zacharius. Pepin put paid to the Lombards, twice evicted from the Duchy of Rome's territory. This led to the 'Donation of Pepin', a handover of land to the Pope which led to the establishment of the powerful Papal States.\\n\\nHowever, Pepin's death has created a power vacuum that has compromised the structure of the kingdom; its rule is now split between Charlemagne and his brother, Carloman. The two brothers, clearly, do not like each other; both laying claim to be Pepin's sole heir.\\n\\nNow, in AD768, Carloman is surrounded. He holds the more defensible territory but Charlemagne, a distinguished warrior king, controls the wealth and therefore wields the real power. His Frankish Kingdom, as such, now stands strong. Although there are enemies aplenty at the borders, the Franks must first be united before they defeat them. Once that has been achieved, all Europe will embrace the true religion or face death at his hands!	true

Displaced by invading Gokturks in AD553, the Avars fled the collapsing Rouran Khagante and sought refuge, like the barbarian tribes of the steppes before them, in Roman lands. As the 8th century wanes, the Avar Khaganate, reduced in size but once again on its feet, has a solid grasp on its Pannonian powerbase. Although the tenacious Byzantine Romans endure in the east, the Frankish king Charlemagne's power increases in the west and he has vowed to convert all pagans to Christianity or put them to the sword!

The Kingdom of Croatia may be vassalized but they retain most of their independence from the Hungarian throne. The unification of the two realms has brought great stability to the Kingdom of Croatia. Simun is the new Ban of Croatia after he helped András start a rebellion against his older brother Imre. Simun must earn the support of the nobility but also maintain his increased independence and authority from the Hungarian throne. The Omis pirates that operate from the shores of Croatia recognize the King of Hungary and the Ban of Croatia, these expert shipbuilders provide Simun with an opportunity to raid nearby settlements with fast ships. The communes of the Adriatic provide the Kingdom of Croatia greater wealth and reduce construction times. Being the vassals of Hungary has many benefits for Croatia but for the Kingdom to restore its former completely independent self it must exploit weaknesses within Hungary. The Kingdom of Hungary is ruled by Queen Gertrude as regent during her husband's long absences which provide Simun with an opportunity to break away from the vassalization contract between the Kingdom of Hungary and Croatia. If Simun successfully rebels against the Kingdom of Hungary, it will elevate his position as king and he can expand the Kingdom of Croatia's borders. Will Simun become the true king of Croatia or will he forever be in the shadow of the King of Hungary? - Wolf669	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120157864	The death of the great Zhupan came as a shock to the Grand Principality. It sent the people into worry about what would happen next, especially since Nemanja saw fit to pass the throne to his middle son Stefan and not the eldest, Vukan. The land spiraled into civil war and although beaten at first, Stefan would regain the throne from his older brother with the help of the Bulgarians. This however meant little in the terms of relations with Serbia's eastern neighbor. The drums of war rage between the bitter rivals and the large piles of the dead did little to prevent Serbia from pursuing yet another war, this time for supremacy of the Peninsula. The young Stefan is ambitious, truly more then any other Zhupan that has come before him, perhaps even more then Nemanja himself. Stefan hopes to finally defeat Serbia's bitter rival in the East and more importantly to make Serbia into a proper Kingdom. In order to do this, he needs the support of a strong religious leader. The Eastern church however does not seem willing, the Byzantine church prevents the Serbs from gaining patriarchal authority and Byzantium itself has stopped Serbia's spread to its south. There may yet be an opportunity to obtain a crown from the Catholic pope, who is looking to gain influence in the Balkans following the break between the Latin and Orthodox Church over a century ago. The Zhupan is beset by petty rivalry of the Serbian nobles that has plagued the land for generations. The nobles are loyal while the Bulgarian lion roars to its West but this is the only thing keeping them united. The greatest challenge for the young Zhupan will not be to defeat his bitter rival but to rather keep the rebellious and disloyal aristocracy aligned to his people and under his grip. If the Zhupan succeeds, Serbia's destiny to rule the Balkans will be ever closer. -Aleksa Šuković	true

Over the last centuries, invasions from African Muslims and Normans have added to the already particular blend of Byzantine, Lombard and Italian cultures in Southern Italy. And now, the royal throne has passed to Frederick of the Hohenstaufen, a German family, who happens to be anti-King and pretender to the imperial throne. A wealthy kingdom where royal patronage has led to a vibrant intellectual life, Sicily has now been thrust into the most explosive of all political landscapes. The impending civil war between Otto and Frederick is only a small part of a larger theater where Imperial and Papal temporal power clash endlessly. It was not long ago that Frederick’s father and his supporters were in direct conflict with the Pope and his own allies, and circumstances can quickly change. Frederick has Papal support for now, but once his scores are settled with the Welfs, will he then be at odds with the Holy See? Only time will tell how far Frederick’s ambition will take him and his heirs, but with careful action and a strong will, the imperial throne and supremacy over all of Italy lie within his grasp.	true

Situated along the Moselle, the Duke has effective control over an important trade route and extensive farmland. Moreover, tensions between France and the Empire are approaching a boiling point.

During the treaty of Verdun of 843 and the succession of the empire of Charlemagne, The area containing the duchy of Flanders was given to king Charles the Bald and placed under the administration of the first margrave of Flanders; Baldwin iron Arm, while keeping its function as a military marcher. His family will control the county of Flanders until 1280, fighting off Viking attacks, building up glorious castles, defensive positions and rich cities of arts and trade, as well as plotting for 300 years to slowly increase the size of their fiefdom and their influence in the courts of the kingdom of the French, the English and the Holy Roman Empire. culminating in 1204 AD when, after joining the fourth crusade against the byzantines, Baldwin IX was crowned emperor of Constantinople (a title short-lived as he died a year later at the hands of the Bulgars).In 1212 AD, the county of Flanders and Hainaut is a rich land of trade and textile, ruled by Ferdinand of Portugal, who just got married to the daughter of Baldwin of Constantinople, Jeanne. Its position in the center of western Europe is both a blessing and a curse. Indeed, this delicate position gives the county a solid grasp on European trade, but they border three powerful and rival entities: the kingdom of France, the kingdom of England and the Holy Roman Empire.

Defensible thanks to their separation from the mainland, subjugating or conquering the rest of the isles leaves nothing but benefits to a shrewd ruler. The Angevins, having ascended to the throne under Geoffrey of Anjou and his wife, Matilda, reached the peak of their power in 1151 after their son Henry II’s marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine granted them the political and martial strength to force the King Stephen of England to name Henry as his heir 1153, which allowed him to effectively rule England, and have the title officially bestowed upon Henry in 1154 following Stephen’s death. This granted the new King not only the throne of England, but also gave him rule over Aquitaine, Normandy, and Rouen. Eleanor gave birth to two sons of equal fame and notoriety. Richard I, a great warrior and beloved King, and John I. By now however, England has seen better days. Scots and Irish to the north contemplate revolt, and the nobles have lost faith in their King. Once the pinnacle of feudal achievement led by previous Angevin kings, King John the First has neglected his duties for more frivolous and greedy pursuits. The younger brother of King Richard The Lionheart, he ruled in all but name whilst his brother partook in the Third Crusade, spending all but six months of his reign away from the throne. And, fortuitously for John, Richard would never return from his crusade, instead dying whilst besieging a French Castle at Chalûs, of gangrene from a crossbow wound in April of 1199. Since then, the upstart French Capetian Dynasty has become emboldened by John’s mishandling of his nobles and took the opportunity to take back lost holdings. After numerous and humiliating defeats, John I was dishonored with the moniker “John Lackland” for the loss of his birthrights. Now though, with new allies and new opportunities in 1212, John “Lackland” may have the chance to rewrite his legacy, and make the Capetians pay for their actions with interest. - Mortimer	true

Exactly two hundred and forty years ago, Harold Bluetooth, the Viking King of the Danes, embraced Christianity, not just personally, but also on behalf of his people. Though the Vikings' fierce conviction in battle was a true asset, forsaking these pagan ways and embracing Catholicism is what has actually elevated Denmark into a true northern power. With the Empire and other Catholic Kingdoms offering support against stubborn Viking pagans, the Kings of Denmark now enjoy an absolute authority that has never been seen in the region before. No mortal army could possibly dream of approaching Norway or Sweden's northern reaches, making the region an ideal set of easily defendable homelands. Since Valdemar has taken the throne, his ambitions have materialized into significant expansion. The Northern part of Germany has fallen under Danish control and since Emperor Otto, a former ally, has been busy dealing with unruly princes, Catholic lands to the South, or maybe pagan lands in the Baltic, are free for King to carve away into his northern empire. -FuzFuzFuz	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120158277	The great city of Antioch stands as one of the mightiest settlements in all of the Levant, considered by many to be the core which holds the Christian kingdoms of Outremer together. Captured from the Seljuks during the events of the First Crusade, the city was claimed by Bohémond of Taranto, who then founded the Principality of Antioch in 1098, second of the four Crusader States. Amidst the ever-changing political landscape of the region, the principality has endured for over a hundred years, though not without its share of blessings and tribulations. The strong initial position of the crusader princes, united as fledgling Christian states in a hostile land, have been marred by court intrigue and petty disputes, resulting in conflicts amongst Christians rather than a united front against the openly hostile Muslims. It was this very manner of quarreling that led to the County of Edessa falling to Atabeg Imad ad-Din Zengi in 1144, which then served as a catalyst for the Second Crusade in 1147. Under the rule of Bohémond IV, Antioch and its allies now find themselves entrenched along the Levantine coast, and firmly on the backfoot. The rise of Saladin and the Ayyubid Sultanate has united the forces of Islam against the Christians, presenting the crusaders with a seemingly insurmountable foe. The crushing defeat at Hattin in 1187 and the loss of Jerusalem seemed to spell the end for the Crusader States, but the timely arrival of Third Crusade has given the remaining Frankish enclaves some brief respite. With the collapse of the Byzantines in the West, and his own rule threatened by the Cilician-backed usurper Raymond-Rupen, Bohémond IV must quell the unrest in his court before looking to ward off an inevitable incursion by the Ayyubids. -S.

The Normans unfortunately proved to be a far more dangerous foe, and the Southern kingdoms fell under the yoke of the Norman kings of England in the wake of their conquests across the Isles. However, the fiery spirit of Welsh independence proved to be hard to contain and revolts against Norman rule restored much of Wales to rulers of its own people. The success of the Welsh princes proved to create its own problems, with ambitious nobles seeking their part of the reconquered lands. Forged from the fires of internal strife, Llywelyn of Gwynedd has proven himself to be a charismatic leader, a resourceful politician and a capable soldier. Undisputed ruler of Gwynedd for over a decade, he had managed to placate John of England through marriage and treaty and consolidated his rule over the North of Wales through conquest. Recent disputes have put him at odds with John and Welsh nobles, but Welsh support has returned to Llywelyn. With the English court presently in turmoil, it is as good a time for Wales to assert its independence and secure the future of its people. The countless invaders of Britain, as crashing waves would, have only finely shaped the rocks with which the Welsh shall build their legacy!	true

Seljuk Sultan Sanjar's antics against Shah Astiz quickly soured the relation between both, and the Qara-Khitai invasion proved to be a fortuitous event. With Sanjar defeated, the Khwarazm-Shah managed to consolidate power in the province. However, the impact of the Anushteginid dynasty only truly came about during the reign of Shah Tekish (1172-1200). An ambitious ruler, he married a Qangli princess, tying himself to the Turkish tribes of Khwarazm and ensuring a steady stream of manpower. His conquests brought much of the Iranian world under his rule and ended the dynasty of the Iranian Seljuks. These conflicts turned the Shah and the Caliph al-Nasir against one another, leading to various diplomatic incidents which would set the table for Tekish's successor. Ala ad-Din Muhammad II succeeded his father and pursued the same expansionist policies. By 1212, the Khwarazmian realm has now eclipsed their Ghurid rivals and finished the conquest of Khorasan, cast off the Qara-Khitai yoke and stands alone at the top of the Iranian world. Barring a major setback, the Anushteginid dynasty appears set to settle its scores with the troublesome Caliph and the fractioned Ghurid kingdoms.	true

Migration to the Cilician Highlands and the Mediterranean coast in Roman territory increased heavily from this development, and numerous noble families settled in the Taurus mountains. The collapse of Roman leadership in Anatolia following the battle of Manzikert and the Seljuk conquests led to greater independence of the Armenian lords of Cilicia, who were nominally led by the Princes of the Roupenian dynasty . The Crusades brought a new and powerful ally to the Armenian people and close ties grew with the foreign Franks, largely at the expense of the former overlords of the Armenians in Constantinople. Once Levon assumed leadership of the realm in 1187, he quickly used his keen political acumen to start a series of reforms and diplomatic arrangements. He united the Armenian church with the Catholic church in exchange for the title of King, restructured the realm into a modern feudal state where the former princes of Cilicia became barons who owed him fealty, granted numerous fortresses to the military orders, granted merchant rights to Italian republics to promote commerce and secured a claim for his family on the Principality of Antioch. With a resurgent and prosperous Armenian realm in Cilicia, the Armenian can finally look to push back the Turkish invaders and reunite the ancient lands of Tigranes.	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120158173	Bohemia certainly is unique amongst all members of the Holy Roman Empire. Its unique heritage as a Slavic state comes from pragmatic diplomacy of the Bohemian dukes seeking stability during the collapse of Great Moravia, tying themselves in vassalage to the East Francian kings. Otto, first Holy Roman Emperor, rewarded the loyalty and service of the Premyslids by adding Moravia to their domain, and the Dukes of Bohemia slowly took a commanding position amongst imperial princes. While others may have called themselves kings, the privilege of ruling over a true kingdom, one that was recognized by the Emperor himself, would only come under the enlightened rule of Ottokar. Truly gifted in politics, Ottokar took advantage of dynastic struggles within the Empire to firmly secure a king’s crown, for himself and his descendants. Standing alone as king with only the Emperor lording over him, the ageing Ottokar has not finished his work. Civil war threatens the imperial throne, and with such times comes great opportunities for those willing to seek them out. For now, only a king may reside in Bohemia, but the path to imperial ambitions most certainly is being built – brick by brick – from Prague.	true

A group of nomadic pastoralists from Khwarazm, the Seljuk migrated into Iran and took it by force at the head of a large Turkmen confederation. Once the Near East had been consolidated under strong Seljuk leadership in Iran, the perennial raids from the Turkish tribesmen led to direct conflict with the Roman emperor, whose army fell at Manzikert in 1071, paving the way for Turkish conquest in Anatolia. Following the traditional assignment of land as apanages of the Turks, the Seljuks of Rum consolidated power in Anatolia, increasing their prestige and pressing the neighbouring Christians. The assassination of Malik-Shah, Sultan of the Great Seljuks, in 1092 proved to be an opportune event for the Sultan of Rum, as the chaos that erupted gave him, like many in the disintegrating Great Seljuk realm, the opportunity to carve out their own independent realm, free from Seljuk politics in Iran. The freedom was short-lived, as Crusaders from beyond the sea to help the resurgent empire under the Komnenoi and inflicted several setbacks. Now after a century of back and forth with the Romans, Franks and Georgians, the Seljuk realm is firmly on the edge of both collapse and greatness. Internal politics threatens the very stability of the realm as the untimely death of Sultan Kaikusrau against the greatly weakened Romans in 1211 has pitted the ambitions of the Seljuk princes against each other and thrust Sultan Kaikaus in a very fragile situation. However, the Romans are scattered and weak, and Europe stands open to the ambitions of any Turk who can unite the unruly tribes of Anatolia.	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120157872	After fierce wars against the Byzantine Empire, the Dulo clan established a new Bulgar domain in the lower Danube in 681. While keeping their old warrior culture, the Bulgars united with the local Thracian and Slavic population, forming Bulgaria. During their rule, the Dulo clan forged an empire under the title of ‘Tsardom’ and prospered in their lands. In 864, seeking new allies, King Boris officially accepted Orthodox Christianity, massacring the rebellious Bolyar elite. After more than three centuries, the First Bulgarian Tsardom was conquered by the Byzantines. Suffering from oppressive greek rule and raids from the Normans and the Crusaders, the Bulgarians organized many failed uprisings. In 1185, the brothers Asen and Petar succeeded in their rebellion and created the Second Bulgarian Tsardom. Slowly the brothers took back the Bulgarian lands, enlarging their armies and reestablishing Bulgarian rule. Asen was killed by his cousin Ivanko and a group of bolyars killed Petar. Their younger brother Kaloyan took the throne and made a truce with Pope Innocent III, who acknowledged Bulgaria on the political map. He conquered Macedonia and Thrace, and later annihilated the Latin knights from the Fourth Crusade and stopped their expansion, with the help of his brother-in-law's Cuman army. Kaloyan was killed in a conspiracy by his generals. In 1208, his nephew Boril lost territories against the Latins and Byzantines. He then made an alliance with the Hungarians against the rebelling Cuman generals, granting them lands in Serbia. Will Boril maintain his rule, or will the rightful ruler Ivan Asen II take his father's throne and make the Bulgarian dream of having land on three seas come true? - Legendarian	true

Since the arrival of the Goths in the 3rd century, no man could call this land his own, as waves of migrators washed on the shores of the Danubian frontier and displaced the previous tenants, only to be displaced in turn by new arrivals. But one tenacious people endures. The Vlachs make their homes in the highlands of the Southern Carpathians and South of the Danube, from where they migrate into neighboring lands in search of grazing grounds and trade. When the Asen Brothers revolted against the Empire of the Romans, the Vlachs joined the rebels and assisted in re-establishing the Bulgarian Empire. Under the dominion of the Bulgarian Tsar, the Vlach people enjoyed a period of relative peace, which allowed them to grow and prosper. However, in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, the Tsar has turned his attention southwards. At the same time, the Hungarian Kings seek to expand beyond their borders, and have enlisted the aid of the Teutonic Knights, while in the East, the warlike Cumans consolidate their power and increase the frequency of their vicious raids. As the Bulgarians pursue their imperial ambitions, the Vlach communes are now banding together and seek out the leadership of Voivodes. Stuck between great powers, but bolstered by their experience in the Uprising, the Vlachs are poised to struggle with their neighbors for control of the land beyond the Danube. The masterful guidance of a powerful Voivode is needed to lead the Vlach people to independence, and beyond. -Roberick	true

He first forced his charge, Arslan Shah, effectively a puppet, onto the Great Seljuk throne and used his forces to hold control over most of Iran. The death of Ildegiz provoked a series of conflicts between the upstart Seljuk Sultans and the Atabegs of Azerbaijan, culminating in the dethroning of the Seljuks and the Ildegizid Atabeg Qizil Arslan claiming the throne for himself. The assassination of Qizil Arslan opened the floodgates, with the Georgian rivals of the Ildegizids and the Khwarazm-Shah attacking the largely diminished state. Despite this, Atabeg Uzbeg still has an opportunity to reverse the tide. Azerbaijan has attracted countless Turkmen tribes in their quest for free lands and plunder from their ghazi expeditions and other matters have kept the Khwarazm-Shah distracted for now. Atabeg Uzbeg must first look to put an end to the Georgian menace, then a push to claim back the lands Ildegizid held dominion over can begin in earnest.	true

Eric’s father King Canute I died in 1195 whilst his sons were still in their youth. However, the throne was passed over to Sverker Karlsson from the house of Sverker possibly due to the influence of a powerful individual, Jarl Birger Brosa. After the death of Birger Brosa, the deceased king's sons and their supporters made their claim to the throne but King Sverker did not oblige and the brothers had to escape to Norway.The brothers returned to Sweden in 1205 with Norwegian backing but were defeated by King Sverker and all three of Eric’s brothers were killed. Eric survived the onslaught and escaped back to Norway to plan his next move. In 1208 Eric returned again with Norwegian backing and this time overwhelmingly defeated the Swedish King backed by Danish troops in the Battle of Lena with King Sverker escaping to Denmark. After the battle, Eric took the name of King of Sweden.Sverker was not willing to give up his throne without a fight however and applied for an intervention by the Pope. The Pope ordered three bishops to persuade Eric to come to terms with Sverker or face serious consequences. These persuasion attempts failed however and in 1210 Sverker invaded Sweden in an attempt to reconquer the throne. Sverker’s and Eric’s forces met in the Battle of Gestilren. This time Sverker did not manage to Escape and was killed by a party led by one of Eric’s Jarls and thus the war was over.Only at the age of around 30, King Eric had managed to formulate a network of followers in a short time without the support of the Church and managed to defeat troops from Denmark, the major Scandinavian power at the time. After the victory at the Battle of Gestilren, King Eric quickly reconciled with the Danish king as well as the Catholic Church and even married a Danish princess to better the relations between the two Scandinavian kingdoms.The beginning of Eric’s reign was stormy to say the least, being in a struggle for the throne, at war with the Kingdom of Denmark and at odds with the Church.As the rainy days passing and light start shining through the clouds, what great destiny shall Sweden step into? If Eric able to manage to gain Papal confirmation of his rule, and consolidate the power within Sweden, the kingdom may become a great power of the Baltic, perhaps spreading her wings to the Pagan region of the Baltics in the name of Christ? - Niko Niemelä	true

The Danes, hemmed into the Jutland Peninsula by the belligerence of Charlemagne, swindled by Christian merchants and failed by their crops, represent just such a kingdom. For centuries, the Scandinavian warrior societies were defined by their highly aggressive nature, but until now, their relations with the rest of the world have been primarily peaceful – defined by the unusual trading reach their superior vessels provided them. Now, troubles within and without have transformed the prevailing attitude into one of open belligerence and disregard for Christian borders. However, the Danes’ population now exceeds the capacity of their lands, forcing them to turn to raiding and pillaging for sustenance. This, in combination with the privations forced upon them by their intolerant, pious, Christian neighbours, has forced them to take action. As the Christian world, led by Charlemagne, seeks to choke the life out of paganism, the Danes will lead the counterattack. With the aid of their famed longboats, no land is beyond the reach of their lightning raids – the brutal Viking warriors - who fear only an ignominious, shameful death - will return laden with loot, drenched in the salty sea and the blood of their pathetic, cowering foes!	true

Eventually, Tournai, under Childeric I, rose to dominate the region with Rome’s help.

Yet the Frankish Kingdom is also strong without; Clovis’ fourth son, Theuderic, is poised to eclipse its neighbours – and one-time allies – the Burgundians, and to the south, the last foothold of the Visigothic Kingdom on Gaulish soil. There is also the question of the Ostrogoths, who flounder now that Theoderic the Great lies dead – their lands are ripe for the taking too, if Rome doesn’t get there first. Yet the noble blood of Childeric and Clovis flows through the king’s veins; he alone can unite his people; he alone will see the Franks become the sole power in Gaul, and beyond!	true

Despite the fall of Roman authority in the West, Venice kept its ties to its overlord, profiting from its eroding authority and gaining much autonomy when the Exarchate of Ravenna fell. From its own particular circumstances arose a true Republic, where wealthy merchant-princes rule as a group, and new institutions were created. The Doge, an elected ruler by the council, became a central figure, with extensive powers, allowing cunning individuals, such as Enrico Dandolo, to extend the Venetian sphere of influence when the occasion arose. At the dawn of the 13th century, the strong merchant city of Venice ascended to an imperial status following the Fourth Crusade, establishing the Latin Empire as a client state from the ashes of the Roman Empire of the Komnenoi in 1204 and numerous colonies on the Eastern Mediterranean. With an extensive, experienced and mobile navy, the leading Venetian seafarers of the century established lucrative trade routes across the Adriatic, Mediterranean and Black Sea. After generations of dominating the seas, traversing the mediterranean and culling pirate threats - today’s Venice stands strong, so long as they assiduously protect their island cities. With no concrete boast of a strong military, the Venetian’s weaknesses lie to the borders of their own neighbors including the subtle, envious glare of Genoa in the West. With future wars in the Holy Land destined to continue, competitive and cut-throat politics are born without careful consideration. -Dead Signal	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120157844	Following the usurpation of Isaak Angelos in 1185, the era of cultural blossoming and prosperity under the Komnenoi came to an end, leading to a drastic decline of the once mighty Byzantine Empire, ultimately resulting in the sack and conquest of Constantinople by western Crusaders in 1204. Far away from the capital during the events, Alexios Komnenos, grand-child of the last Emperor of the Komnenoi Andronikos, alongside his brother David, conquered the Roman city of Trebizond and established a realm stretching along the southern shore of the black sea as well as the coastline of the Crimean peninsula. Declaring himself Emperor and supported by his Georgian allies, Alexios and his brother, the Co-emperor, have set their sights on crushing the Byzantine successors in Nicaea and Epirus, and reclaiming Constantinople from the Latins. The nascent Empire found itself in conflict with the Seljuks of Rum but successfully survived the siege. A relentless push West followed, and following the peace treaty of 1211 between the Seljuks of Rum and the Empire of Nicaea, the Komnenoi brothers are now facing a combined attack by the two. This precarious situation is concerning, but with apt commanders, sound administration and the backing of regional power, the Emperors of Trebizond may yet restore to the Empire the territories that rightfully belong to it. -Aristides Aemilianos	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120158844	After a devastating succession crisis 100 years prior, the Kingdom of Croatia has been vassalized by the king of Hungary. The Kingdom of Croatia may be vassalized but they retain most of their independence from the Hungarian throne. The unification of the two realms has brought great stability to the Kingdom of Croatia. Simun is the new Ban of Croatia after he helped András start a rebellion against his older brother Imre. Simun must earn the support of the nobility but also maintain his increased independence and authority from the Hungarian throne. The Omis pirates that operate from the shores of Croatia recognize the King of Hungary and the Ban of Croatia, these expert shipbuilders provide Simun with an opportunity to raid nearby settlements with fast ships. The communes of the Adriatic provide the Kingdom of Croatia greater wealth and reduce construction times. Being the vassals of Hungary has many benefits for Croatia but for the Kingdom to restore its former completely independent self it must exploit weaknesses within Hungary. The Kingdom of Hungary is ruled by Queen Gertrude as regent during her husband's long absences which provide Simun with an opportunity to break away from the vassalization contract between the Kingdom of Hungary and Croatia. If Simun successfully rebels against the Kingdom of Hungary, it will elevate his position as king and he can expand the Kingdom of Croatia's borders. Will Simun become the true king of Croatia or will he forever be in the shadow of the King of Hungary? - Wolf669	true

Is truly an ancient land, the kingdom was formed and defeating the remnants of the bygone kingdom of Aksum by the first Zagwean Queen Gudit in 960 AD and forming her kingdom south of the Aksum. The Zawge people claim to have a strong bond with Christendom for as in 1137 AD, the Zawgean King Mara Takla Haymanot entered marriage with the last negus of Aksum Dil Na'od, of the Solomonic dynasty who has lineal descent from the biblical King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. However, even with the legendary claims of being descendants of holy and wise figures, Zagwe's hegemony is not yet complete. For the kingdom was a complete mystery to the rest of Europe and vice versa, due to its isolation by Muslim conquests of Egypt and Jerusalem. But the people of the kingdom wish to reunite with their rightful dynastical homeland of Judea, although in their way stands Makuria who like them are fellow Christians who's kingdom who can be incorporated under their divine rule, the main opponent however the Muslims who control the land north of the Nile and the holy land will be a hard foe.

As one of the former capitals of the Roman Empire, it has the basis to be the strongest individual City-State in the Po valley. Its huge population means that it could harness wealth and manpower that the other communes in the area simply could not. It possesses a strong industrial base, including in arms manufacturing. It also holds the relics of Saint Ambrose within his Basilica, giving it significant prestige within the Catholic world. After the peace of Konstanz, and in particular after having won the battle of Legnano against the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, it has grown to become the most significant commune of the Lombard League, dominating its local area. Yet all is not well. It has numerous rivals that despise it, like Lodi. And even inside the city, there is significant strife amongst rival families, increasing corruption, heretics and the changing of the political institutions.If the city is to thrive and take its rightful place as the sole greatest power in Italy, it needs to unite itself before uniting the other cities. This will be challenged as the Guelph-Ghibelline Feud is at its strongest and a new rising star in the South of the peninsula is sure to rekindle old conflicts. And even still, to assume leadership the peninsula will be hard as the Pope will seek to keep it perpetually divided to safeguard himself and the other cities will not allow for one of them to rise amongst the rest unopposed. -Skobtsov	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120158340	For centuries, the Zenata Berber Banu Marin had dwelled the landscape of the Maghreb, engaging predominantly in semi-nomadic pastoralism for sustenance in the dry desert climate. Initially inhabiting the region around the city of Biskra (present-day Algeria), they would migrate at regular intervals between oases to graze their herds of domesticated animals, moving frequently between Sijilmasa, Figuig and the Moulouya River (present-day Morocco). In the early 13th century, owing to the arrival of Arab tribes in the area, they migrated en-masse deeper into the lands of modern-day Morocco, with the Almohad Caliphate as their powerful overlord.As loyal subjects of the Empire, the Banu Marin had served alongside the armies of the Almohad Caliph, most notably during the stunning victory of Caliph Abu Yusuf Ya’qub al-Mansur over the army of King Alfonso VIII of Castille at the Battle of Alarcos in 1195, where Abu Jalil Mahyu ibn Abi Bakr, chief of the Banu Marin, died commanding the Banu Marin volunteers fighting at the vanguard of the Caliph’s army. With the bitter Castillian king once again confronting the Almohads in an attempt to realise his expansionist ambitions against Al-Andalus, the Banu Marin will maintain a watchful eye towards the Caliphate as subsequent events unfold; If the opportunity presents itself, the Banu Marin could perhaps forge a legacy of their own, as masters rather than subjects... - Soup of Can	true
start_pos_factions_description_2120158540	The collapse of the Great Seljuk empire has left the Iranian world ripe for the taking. Seljuk Sultan Sanjar's antics against Shah Astiz quickly soured the relation between both, and the Qara-Khitai invasion proved to be a fortuitous event. With Sanjar defeated, the Khwarazm-Shah managed to consolidate power in the province. However, the impact of the Anushteginid dynasty only truly came about during the reign of Shah Tekish (1172-1200). An ambitious ruler, he married a Qangli princess, tying himself to the Turkish tribes of Khwarazm and ensuring a steady stream of manpower. His conquests brought much of the Iranian world under his rule and ended the dynasty of the Iranian Seljuks. These conflicts turned the Shah and the Caliph al-Nasir against one another, leading to various diplomatic incidents which would set the table for Tekish's successor. Ala ad-Din Muhammad II succeeded his father and pursued the same expansionist policies. By 1212, the Khwarazmian realm has now eclipsed their Ghurid rivals and finished the conquest of Khorasan, cast off the Qara-Khitai yoke and stands alone at the top of the Iranian world. Barring a major setback, the Anushteginid dynasty appears set to settle its scores with the troublesome Caliph and the fractioned Ghurid kingdoms.	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120157649	Called Caledonia by the Romans, the northern part of Britain was one of the few places in Western Europe that the Roman Empire never conquered. Initially a land made up of the Brythonic Picts, from the 7th century onward a wide variety of people moved into the peninsula, from the Britons in the south, shortly followed by the Angles, to the Gaels in the west and the Vikings in the east and north. In 843 Kenneth MacAlpin became the first king of Alba, and the Gaels and Picts assimilated together to form the modern Scots. Since then Scotland had expanded, conquering the Kingdom of Strathclyde and controlling most of the northern half of the island. However, for much of the High Middle Ages, the state of affairs of Scotland hinged on the English state to her south. While raids into England from the north had been common practice since Roman times, starting in 1072, and again in 1080 Norman forces launched reprisal invasions into Scotland due to the raiding and interference of King Duncan III (of Macbeth fame). Duncan was killed in battle in 1093, and starting in 1124 with David I, a new power dynamic was formed, with Scotland growing closer to England and European culture as a whole. In 1174 King William I of Scotland was even forced to accept English overlordship in the Treaty of Falaise - the first instance of English dominion in Scotland. It would only become free again in 1189 when Richard the Lionheart sold Scotland back to William I for £6,600. At the dawn of the 13th century, Scotland is in a precarious position. Her recently bought independence is at constant risk from the English, who could march north at any stage and solidify their holdings in Britain. In her remote corner of Europe Scotland is secure, but she is isolated and has few allies to call on, her only land neighbor being her primary rival. For Scotland to succeed, she must fight the uphill battle to establish hegemony on the British Isles against the superior English forces, along with curtailing Nordic expansionism in the north and west. If that all can be accomplished, Scotland will be in a secure spot to trade, expand, and become a major player in international politics. Should the people of Scotland succeed here, the country can transform - from a distant, northern, corner of the Europe, to the center of the North Sea. - KimJongUnusual	true
start_pos_factions_description_2120157849	The Kingdom of Georgia since its founding has gone through many trials by fire.  Immediately after the reunification of 1008, the Georgian state found itself caught between a stalking Byzantine eagle from the southwest and a leaping Seljuk tiger from the southeast. The Georgians first lost to the Byzantines at Svindax in 1022 and were forced to cede territory and hostages to maintain their territorial integrity. When those same Byzantines were dealt a crushing defeat at Manzikert, the Georgians retook the ceded territory, but were promptly invaded and subjugated by the Seljuk victors in 1080, who forced the nascent kingdom to pay an annual tribute. Into this calamity came David IV, known as “The Builder,” who raised a peasant militia against the Seljuks in 1089, and, taking advantage of the First Crusade 7 years later, fragmented the foreign holdings and began to recapture them one by one. David had united the vast majority of Georgia by 1100 and steadily pushed out the Turkish invaders, finally breaking all Seljuk control by seizing Tbilisi in 1122. For the next two years, David continued to attack southwards, also gaining the title of King of the Armenians by 1124. Domestically, David also settled 40,000 Kipchak warriors on farmlands in his kingdom, thus gaining the services of the King of Alania, and invited a wide variety of western mercenaries to assist him in his campaigns against the Muslims. By the time of his death in 1125, David had produced a stable kingdom. 60 years later, Queen Tamar took the throne, and continued her ancestor’s legacy. When Constantinople fell to the Latins, Georgia became the strongest Christian state east of Bulgaria. Taking the initiative, Tamar quickly seized a portion of the Black Sea coastline and invited her relative Alexios Komnenos to become its ruler; in doing so, she had founded the Empire of Trebizond, and made it directly dependent on Georgian interests. By 1210, Georgia had reached its historical territorial apex, and ushered in a Golden Age. It is now 1212 AD, and the Kingdom of Georgia is ruled by Tamar’s son, Georgi IV. The kingdom has never been stronger, and the natural barrier of the Caucuses is still a powerful deterrent to invasions. Look to the west to find your next moves; friendly Trebizond still stands on the Black sea coast, and other Christians still hold the Holy Land against the Saracens. Ensure that you remain on good terms with your religious brethren, and always support them in their endeavors, for they will support you in return. Finally, maintain a careful eye on the East.

Initially, they were invited to the region by the Roman general Bonifacius who, when convicted of treason, chose to revolt instead of capitulate. However, the Vandals' journey from Hispania was long and, when they finally arrived, Bonifacius had regained the support of the Emperor and the court. Affronted by their flippant dismissal, the Vandals chose instead to attack. They captured Hippo Regius in AD430, before moving to establish themselves at Carthage in AD435. Geiseric, their leader, styled himself “King of the Vandals and Alans”, expanding his new kingdom to Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia, as well as securing his grip on Africa.\\n\\n Although the destruction of lands and religious persecution tied them to their barbarian roots, the Vandals developed a civilised air, becoming great patrons of architecture and learning. Centres of education blossomed across the continent, producing several great academic figures. Rome tried many times to retake its lost lands, but catastrophic naval defeats at Cartagena and Cape Bon forced the Empire to dismantle its plans for invasion, which strengthened the Vandals’ position as the true power in Africa.\\nAs the line of Vandalic kings progressed, a more lenient attitude towards Catholicism developed. However, this caused religious friction that undermined the kingdom, leaving rifts of dissent at the far reaches of the Vandal lands. Now they face both a political quandary and a revitalised Roman invasion under Belisarius. Yet the Vandals have halted the forces of the Empire many times before, and will once again see those who threaten their independence put to the sword!	true

Abu Bakr dealt with this insurgence with brutal swiftness before embarking upon a vast war of conquest, extending the Empire's borders even further. The achievements of the first four caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali) earned them the epithet 'Rashidun', meaning 'rightly chosen'. When Uthman was murdered, the Empire began to destabilise despite Ali's efforts, resulting in the first Islamic Civil War (or Fitna). After much fighting, arbitration and finally Ali's murder, the Umayyad dynasty ascended, creating deep divisions in the Muslim community.

The Battle of Ravenna in AD476 - Rome's final humiliation - signalled the ignoble end of its Western Empire. In its place was the Kingdom of Italy, helmed by the victorious Germanic general, Flavius Odoacer. However, although he was officially recognised by the Eastern Emperor Zeno as 'patrician', Imperial favour is fickle and Odoacer eventually came to be considered a rival claimant to the throne.\\n\\n As such, by AD488 the Ostrogothic king, Theoderic, had been contracted to depose and supplant him as the Emperor's man in Italy. After four years of war, Theoderic emerged victorious and in AD493, after murdering Odoacer at a banquet, assumed control of all Italy. He ruled benevolently, becoming a patron of the arts and architecture and subsuming much of the Western Empire's administrative infrastructure into his own kingdom. However, Theoderic's death in AD526 destabilised the Ostrogothic Kingdom, as his grandson - still a child - ascended to the throne under the regency of his mother, Amalasuntha. Eventually, she appealed to the new Eastern Emperor, Justinian, to intervene. Her subsequent murder by rivals has given Justinian the 'casus belli' - literally the 'case for war' - he needs to reconquer Italy and reclaim the ancient seat of Imperial power.\\n\\n The future of the Ostrogothic Kingdom remains uncertain - the Romans encroach with vengeful determination - and so the current incumbent must be wary if he is to retain control. However, the Ostrogoths seized this wealthy land through much skill and spilled-blood - no man, Roman or otherwise, will wrest it from their iron grasp without a fight!	true

The Visigoths settled astride the Pyrenees, but are constantly at war with the highly-aggressive, expansionist Franks in Gaul. War has also raged away from the battlefield; brothers have killed brothers for the Visigothic throne and the neighbouring Ostrogoths have long had an interest in their neighbour’s affairs. The current king, Theudis, has married a local and raised an independent army, free from Ostrogothic influence. His goals are thus: to recapture the territory lost to the Franks, to consolidate Visigothic holdings in Hispania, and - if the Vandal Kingdom collapses – to acquire land in Africa. Who knows, Visigoths may even be able to dominate Mediterranean trade – making their kingdom far stronger than any before it!	true

The Atabegs, pretending to abide by their duty to serve their charge, one of the many Seljuk princes, wielded true power and tore off pieces of the throne of Isfahan for their own gain. Few were quite as successful, and ruthless, as the Atabeg of Mosul, Imad ad-Din Zengi. Uniting the two major regions of Mosul and Aleppo under his rule, Zengi soon found himself in conflict with the Crusader States. With strategic maneuvering, he managed to force the surrender of city of Edessa in 1144, breaking the County of Edessa and forcing a massive Christian response, the Second Crusade. He would die assassinated by a slave, and his son Nur ad-Din would succeed him. While Zengi proved a dangerous foe to the nascent Crusader States, Nur ad-Din proved himself to be far greater threat. He defeated the Second Crusade and the Frankish attempts at reconquering the territories lost to Zengi. Pushing further, he provoked the Prince of Antioch into a pitched battle which led to a complete defeat for the Antiochenes from which they would never recover, with only the city of Antioch itself remaining in the hands of the Franks. The diplomatic ability of Nur ad-Din brought Damascus and Egypt under Zengid rule, uniting most of the Middle East. He died respected by friend and foe alike, but his short-lived empire crumbled under the pressure of his ambitious vassal, Salah ad-Din. With only a fraction of the Jazira under Zengid control, Izz ad-Din Mas’ud is in quite a precarious position. However, the Ayyubid Sultanate is only strong while a leader can keep the family confederation united, and with new Frankish invasions sure to come in the future, a calculating and skilled leader could reverse the fortune of the Zengid dynasty and bring back the bane of the Franks to the doorstep of the Holy Lands.	true

A group of nomadic pastoralists from Khwarazm, the Seljuk migrated into Iran and took it by force at the head of a large Turkmen confederation. Once the Near East had been consolidated under strong Seljuk leadership in Iran, the perennial raids from the Turkish tribesmen led to direct conflict with the Roman emperor, whose army fell at Manzikert in 1071, paving the way for Turkish conquest in Anatolia. Following the traditional assignment of land as apanages of the Turks, the Seljuks of Rum consolidated power in Anatolia, increasing their prestige and pressing the neighbouring Christians. The assassination of Malik-Shah, Sultan of the Great Seljuks, in 1092 proved to be an opportune event for the Sultan of Rum, as the chaos that erupted gave him, like many in the disintegrating Great Seljuk realm, the opportunity to carve out their own independent realm, free from Seljuk politics in Iran. The freedom was short-lived, as Crusaders from beyond the sea to help the resurgent empire under the Komnenoi and inflicted several setbacks. Now after a century of back and forth with the Romans, Franks and Georgians, the Seljuk realm is firmly on the edge of both collapse and greatness. Internal politics threatens the very stability of the realm as the untimely death of Sultan Kaikusrau against the greatly weakened Romans in 1211 has pitted the ambitions of the Seljuk princes against each other and thrust Sultan Kaikaus in a very fragile situation. However, the Romans are scattered and weak, and Europe stands open to the ambitions of any Turk who can unite the unruly tribes of Anatolia.	true

The Pope had granted them the valuable islands of Corsica and Sardinia in gratitude. They defeated Genoa on the seas and it was their naval laws that shaped the naval world. They had the respect of Popes and Emperors alike and it was once said that the Pisans were greatest naval ally of the Byzantines, even greater than Venice. But at the turn of the century, things have taken a turn for the worse. The Crusader States’ power slowly fades, and with them Pisa's holdings. The Byzantine Empire is broken thanks to Venetian meddling and Pisa finds itself set upon by its major rivals. The greatest battles for Pisa are yet to come. If Pisa is to survive, it must reassert its dominance and explore far and wide for the next financial boon before its rivals carve up what remains amongst themselves. -Warman	true

With the continued loss of Christian lands in the Levant during the early 13th century, the Order has been invited North to crusade against pagans on the borders of Hungary and Poland, following the founding of the Archbishopric of Riga in the Terra Mariana and the successful thrust of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and the Danes. Nominally under the sovereignty of the Holy See in Rome, the military order has largely acted independently since its founding.

Seljuk Sultan Sanjar's antics against Shah Astiz quickly soured the relation between both, and the Qara-Khitai invasion proved to be a fortuitous event. With Sanjar defeated, the Khwarazm-Shah managed to consolidate power in the province. However, the impact of the Anushteginid dynasty only truly came about during the reign of Shah Tekish (1172-1200). An ambitious ruler, he married a Qangli princess, tying himself to the Turkish tribes of Khwarazm and ensuring a steady stream of manpower. His conquests brought much of the Iranian world under his rule and ended the dynasty of the Iranian Seljuks. These conflicts turned the Shah and the Caliph al-Nasir against one another, leading to various diplomatic incidents which would set the table for Tekish's successor. Ala ad-Din Muhammad II succeeded his father and pursued the same expansionist policies. By 1212, the Khwarazmian realm has now eclipsed their Ghurid rivals and finished the conquest of Khorasan, cast off the Qara-Khitai yoke and stands alone at the top of the Iranian world. Barring a major setback, the Anushteginid dynasty appears set to settle its scores with the troublesome Caliph and the fractioned Ghurid kingdoms.	true

His family will control the county of Flanders until 1280, fighting off Viking attacks, building up glorious castles, defensive positions and rich cities of arts and trade, as well as plotting for 300 years to slowly increase the size of their fiefdom and their influence in the courts of the kingdom of the French, the English and the Holy Roman Empire. culminating in 1204 AD when, after joining the fourth crusade against the byzantines, Baldwin IX was crowned emperor of Constantinople (a title short-lived as he died a year later at the hands of the Bulgars).In 1212 AD, the county of Flanders and Hainaut is a rich land of trade and textile, ruled by Ferdinand of Portugal, who just got married to the daughter of Baldwin of Constantinople, Jeanne. Its position in the center of western Europe is both a blessing and a curse. Indeed, this delicate position gives the county a solid grasp on European trade, but they border three powerful and rival entities: the kingdom of France, the kingdom of England and the Holy Roman Empire.

An upstart dynasty who overthrew the remains of the Ghaznavid Sultanate, the Afghan Ghurids quickly became a dominant power in the Eastern Iranian region. Its greatest accomplishment was, however, in breaking the Rajput dynasties in Northern India when Mu'izz ad-Din marched to Tarain and defeated the much larger Rajput force of Prithviraj Chauhan. For a brief moment, the Ghurid empire stretched from Khorasan to Bengal. It was the death of Mu'izz ad-Din's brother and co-ruler Ghiyath ad-Din, which precipitated direct conflict between Mu'izz ad-Din and the Ghurid's archrival, Khwarazm-Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad II. Defeat at his hands pushed the Ghurids back, and the assassination of the Sultan led to a complete collapse of the Sultanate. While the throne passed onto Mu'izz ad-Din's nephew, Ghiyath ad-Din, power would truly be held by his Mamluk commanders, his so-called sons. The new Sultan's power was usurped when one of the senior commanders, Taj ad-Din Yildiz, took control of the royal throne in Ghazni. Isolated and weak, the Sultan could not contain the ambition of the Khwarazm-Shah and lost much territory before being assassinated in 1211. His heir and son was carried off to Khwarazm to be kept as a hostage, and Taj ad-Din finds himself at the top of the hierarchy in Afghanistan, struggling against Ghurid princes and fellow Mamluk commanders. The direct threat to his kingdom is the expansionist Ala ad-Din Muhammad, but he is also directly threatened by other former commanders, most importantly, the successor of Aybak, the so-called king of Delhi, Iltutmish.	true

Still seated in Constantinople since the days of Constantine, and leading the Christian people in the East, the Emperors enjoyed great prosperity and respect despite numerous setbacks, maintaining still the Glory of Rome in a new age. The Komnenos dynasty, who oversaw a great resurgence in imperial power late in the 11th century, has been deposed and the Angelos dynasty took the throne near the end of the 12th century. Greed and lust for power by the Angeloi caused the Empire to open itself to internal and external enemies. The first Emperor of the dynasty, Isaac II, was blinded and cast away into a cell by his ambitious brother Alexios III who obtained the throne for himself. Serious misgovernment and ill-treatment of the people lead to the Turks regaining land that the Komnenoi reconquered from the invaders. The deposed ex-Emperor's son Alexios IV asked the crusaders for assistance in regaining the throne. He promised gold, silver, as well as men and ships for their crusade to Egypt. By 1203, they had reached Constantinople and demanded Alexios III to give up the throne. When he declined, the first siege begun. After Roman setbacks, Alexios III fled the city, leaving Alexios IV to be crowned co-Emperor by his father's side. Alexios III's short reign had the city divided between both factions, and Alexios Doukas, a high court official, rose up and overthrew both Isaac II and Alexios IV, casting them in prison where they finally perished. Since the agreement with the crusaders was shattered, they besieged the city for a second time and eventually overcame the defenders. Constantinople, the city of the world’s desire, was viciously sacked and the Empire was partitioned. The last remnants of the Romans were scattered in Nicaea, Epirus and Trebizond. Theodore I Laskaris, rose to the throne in Nicaea, rallying the most significant part of the Roman nobility, and lead several counter attacks against the new Latin Empire and thwarting a major Seljuk invasion, killing the Sultan Kaikusrau in 1211. The truce that was signed following this significant victory could possibly buy enough time for Theodore to throw his strength at the Komnenoi in Trebizond and the Latins on the Anatolian coast. The true objective, however, will always be to send the Latins back to the sea, and to sit triumphant in the ancient capital of Constantinople. -AnTMaN	true

The Baltic tribes have been calling the Baltic region their home since moving in from central Europe around 3000-2500BC. The Baltic tribes did not really experience the changes of the first millennium, living in the Baltic area for long without any serious threat. Proofs of their existence come from different reliable sources, although not much is known of them. The most prominent Baltic people, the Lithuanians are not an exception either, with the first mention of “Lithuania” as a nation dating to 1006 AD in the ‘Quedlinburg Chronicle’.  .In the 9-11th centuries, the Baltic coast was subjected to Viking raids and later on a Ruthenian invasion. However, from the mid-12th century onward, it was the Lithuanians’ turn: the Lithuanians could field a formidable force threatening those Russian principalities whom they paid tributes to for a long time. They invaded Ruthenian territories, reaching as far as the distant Novgorod republic. The successful campaigns enabled the Lithuanians to centralise, but the tribes were still fragmented. and by the 13th century the once small collection of Lithuanian Pagan tribes united to form the Duchy of Lithuania.Now, in 1212, Lithuania is one of the last strongholds of the Baltic Pagan faith.  Being pagan they are threatened by the monastic military order of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword who seek to conquer and Christianise the land of the Lithuanians.

If the Duchy can strengthen its position it could face the new Christian enemy or even join their ranks and turn to eastern lands.

The house of Toulouse was mainly known since the last years of the XIth century through the name of count Raymond IV, one of the main leaders who successfully led the armies of the First Crusade all the way down to Jerusalem. His successor however, Alphonse-Jourdain, was not the politician his father was and had to make political concessions to the newly-formed kingdom of Aragon. Moreover, the counts also had to face the rapacity of the Plantagenets and Capetian kings who sought to seize Toulouse and dismember their county. Although the situation considerably improved during the late twelfth century with an alliance between Toulouse and Aragon, the growing rumors regarding the spread of dualistic heresies within the South of France attracted the attention of both secular and religious authorities. A simili crusade launched by the Cistercians in the early 1180s further increased the tensions and the murder of a papal legate in the dawn of the thirteenth century proved to be the perfect casus belli for a direct intervention of the barons of the northern half of the kingdom.

It would be the rise of Vladimir’s son Yaroslav the Wise in which Kyiv saw its greatest extent and influence despite having to fight a bloody civil war against his half-brother Svyatopolk who was backed by his father in law Bolesław the Brave duke and future king of Poland. Yaroslav would be pushed back to Novgorod but would defeat his half-brother in battle and securing the Kievan Rus by 1019. Yaroslav would introduce new law codes and also would construct a famous cathedral named St. Sophia as well as the famous Golden Gate at the fortress of Kyiv. However, he would divide Kievan Rus among his sons hoping to avoid civil war but only allowed it to become inevitable and after his death, civil war ravaged the kingdom.Though the Kievan Rus was once the mightiest kingdom in all of the land. The Poles, The Khazars, and even the mighty and venerable Byzantines looked North in awe of the might of the Rus. But all that begins must end, and what began under the reign of Vladimir the Great thus ended with the death of his son Yaroslav the Wise in 1054. While the enemies of Kievan Rus grew in power, the sons and brothers of Yaroslav weakened the kingdom and its lands from endless fighting over the throne.Now the city of Kyiv stands alone with the independent princes each ruling over their own cities. To the East, the Grand Kynazates of Chernigov and Vladimir rule over their cities and in the North, the Lithuanians who once paid tribute to Kievan Rus have now carved out their own kingdom from the land the Rus once occupied, even threatening the great city of Novgorod on multiple occasions. To the East the Cumans, Kipchaks, and Volga-Bulgarians are always hungry to expand their realm. However, there has been a recent development: The steppe tribes of the east grew wary of a looming new force to the east. Is it an opportunity to consolidate the power of the Rus once and for all, or an early warning to yet another threat from the east? - Earthmen	true

Its close ties to the Byzantine empire were effectively severed with the Caliphate’s conquests, and Makuria began a long and complicated relationship with the Muslim rulers of Egypt with the signing of the Baqt treaty, a ceasefire which provided for the exchange of specific goods. The payments which were to be made were quite often not honoured and sparked numerous conflicts and punitive expeditions. However, Makuria proved to be a resilient kingdom and the Nubian inhabitants a resilient people. The collapse of Fatimid power in Egypt invigorated Makurian amibitions and the conflict came to a head when Salah ad-Din sent an army to subdue the Makurian forces and caused destruction across Lower Nubia. The campaign ended with a retreat of Ayyubid forces and peace has now been found once more. It is, nonetheless, unlikely that Makuria will be able to thrive in such a lopsided relationship. Ayyubid unity will one day shatter and it will be the opportunity for a warrior-king, bearing the cross, to march through Egypt, free the Coptic Patriarch and his flock from Muslim dominion, restore relations with the Christian world, and secure the future of his people.	true

As a reward for the support of the Almohad revolt against the Almoravids, Abu Muhammad Abd al-Wahid ibn Abi Hafs was granted governorship of the province of Ifriqiya. The capital, Tunis, stands at the end point of one of the main trans-Saharan trade routes, where salt, gold and slaves leave Tunisian ports to be moved across the Mediterranean. With such a stranglehold on a key source of income, the Berber Hafsids are poised to accumulate wealth and power – far from the prying eyes of their Almohad benefactors. Like the Carthaginians who once dominated the Western Mediterranean, a great trading nation may yet again extend its influence – and might – beyond the North African coast.	true

Much like the barbarians and nomads centuries earlier, the Avars - a confederation of displaced Rouran, Hephthal and Turkic people - find themselves in former Roman lands.\\n\\nIn AD577, they entreated with the Empire to take on their enemies in return for safe passage and a place to settle, incorporating any subjugated foes into their confederation. Imperial grace, however, is reliably fickle, and successive Emperors denied the Avars a home in the Balkans. Disgruntled, the nomads went to war, fighting to the very walls of Constantinople in AD626 before finally being broken and driven back.\\n\\nMuch like the Huns before them, the Avars have no central government to build a nation around - the death of a particularly powerful leader could fatally destabilise their society. Civil strife has hastened their descent from power, as has the aggression of the tribal warlord, Samo. Since his death in AD658, the Avars have regained some of their strength and have extended their influence back into their former territories.\\n\\nAs the 8th century wanes, the Avar Khaganate, reduced in size but once again on its feet, has a solid grasp on its Pannonian powerbase. Although the tenacious Byzantine Romans endure in the east, the Frankish king Charlemagne's power grows in the west and he has vowed to convert all pagans to Christianity or put them to the sword!

An upstart dynasty who overthrew the remains of the Ghaznavid Sultanate, the Afghan Ghurids quickly became a dominant power in the Eastern Iranian region. Its greatest accomplishment was, however, in breaking the Rajput dynasties in Northern India when Mu'izz ad-Din marched to Tarain and defeated the much larger Rajput force of Prithviraj Chauhan. For a brief moment, the Ghurid empire stretched from Khorasan to Bengal. It was the death of Mu'izz ad-Din's brother and co-ruler Ghiyath ad-Din, which precipitated direct conflict between Mu'izz ad-Din and the Ghurid's archrival, Khwarazm-Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad II. Defeat at his hands pushed the Ghurids back, and the assassination of the Sultan led to a complete collapse of the Sultanate. While the throne passed onto Mu'izz ad-Din's nephew, Ghiyath ad-Din, power would truly be held by his Mamluk commanders, his so-called sons. The new Sultan's power was usurped when one of the senior commanders, Taj ad-Din Yildiz, took control of the royal throne in Ghazni. Isolated and weak, the Sultan could not contain the ambition of the Khwarazm-Shah and lost much territory before being assassinated in 1211. His heir and son was carried off to Khwarazm to be kept as a hostage, and Taj ad-Din finds himself at the top of the hierarchy in Afghanistan, struggling against Ghurid princes and fellow Mamluk commanders. The direct threat to his kingdom is the expansionist Ala ad-Din Muhammad, but he is also directly threatened by other former commanders, most importantly, the successor of Aybak, the so-called king of Delhi, Iltutmish.	true

His son, Pepin, went even further - defeating the Lombards to secure Papal lands and, with them, his eternal favour.

Now, in AD768, Carloman is surrounded. Charlemagne, a distinguished warrior king, stands strong.

A group of nomadic pastoralists from Khwarazm, the Seljuk migrated into Iran and took it by force at the head of a large Turkmen confederation. Once the Near East had been consolidated under strong Seljuk leadership in Iran, the perennial raids from the Turkish tribesmen led to direct conflict with the Roman emperor, whose army fell at Manzikert in 1071, paving the way for Turkish conquest in Anatolia. Following the traditional assignment of land as apanages of the Turks, the Seljuks of Rum consolidated power in Anatolia, increasing their prestige and pressing the neighbouring Christians. The assassination of Malik-Shah, Sultan of the Great Seljuks, in 1092 proved to be an opportune event for the Sultan of Rum, as the chaos that erupted gave him, like many in the disintegrating Great Seljuk realm, the opportunity to carve out their own independent realm, free from Seljuk politics in Iran. The freedom was short-lived, as Crusaders from beyond the sea to help the resurgent empire under the Komnenoi and inflicted several setbacks. Now after a century of back and forth with the Romans, Franks and Georgians, the Seljuk realm is firmly on the edge of both collapse and greatness. Internal politics threatens the very stability of the realm as the untimely death of Sultan Kaikusrau against the greatly weakened Romans in 1211 has pitted the ambitions of the Seljuk princes against each other and thrust Sultan Kaikaus in a very fragile situation. However, the Romans are scattered and weak, and Europe stands open to the ambitions of any Turk who can unite the unruly tribes of Anatolia.	true

While keeping their old warrior culture, the Bulgars united with the local Thracian and Slavic population, forming Bulgaria. During their rule, the Dulo clan forged an empire under the title of ‘Tsardom’ and prospered in their lands. In 864, seeking new allies, King Boris officially accepted Orthodox Christianity, massacring the rebellious Bolyar elite. After more than three centuries, the First Bulgarian Tsardom was conquered by the Byzantines. Suffering from oppressive greek rule and raids from the Normans and the Crusaders, the Bulgarians organized many failed uprisings. In 1185, the brothers Asen and Petar succeeded in their rebellion and created the Second Bulgarian Tsardom. Slowly the brothers took back the Bulgarian lands, enlarging their armies and reestablishing Bulgarian rule. Asen was killed by his cousin Ivanko and a group of bolyars killed Petar. Their younger brother Kaloyan took the throne and made a truce with Pope Innocent III, who acknowledged Bulgaria on the political map. He conquered Macedonia and Thrace, and later annihilated the Latin knights from the Fourth Crusade and stopped their expansion, with the help of his brother-in-law's Cuman army. Kaloyan was killed in a conspiracy by his generals. In 1208, his nephew Boril lost territories against the Latins and Byzantines. He then made an alliance with the Hungarians against the rebelling Cuman generals, granting them lands in Serbia.

As defenders of the Islamic faith, Abbasid Caliphs trace their bloodline to the Sahabi Al-Abbas, the paternal uncle and trusting companion to The Prophet Himself, peace be upon him. At their height, the Caliph held suzerainty from Sicily to the Indus. However, despite their past glories, the Caliphate is still recovering from more than a century of embarrassment and foreign occupation. Temporal power was greatly diminished when the Caliphs, then residing in Samarra, fell victim to the influence of the Ghulam generals, who had decided to play kingmaker. Following a steady decline in caliphal central authority, the Seljuk Turks overran and wrested hegemony over Iraq from the Caliph in 1055 A.D under their Great Empire. The invaders relegated the once mighty Caliphs to mere religious figureheads, tributaries lying inert in their extravagant court in Baghdad. Despite this, the Caliphate is currently in the midst of a dramatic— albeit modest— resurgence. After reconquering Iraq, gaining de facto independence, and the final collapse of the Turkish Empire in Persia, the seasoned commander and administrator Caliph Al-Nasir seeks to expand the Caliphate's influence. The Seljuk successor in Azerbaijan and the Zengid rump state are tempting targets, as their own military power is fairly minimal. However, the Caliph must first secure the Eastern border, as bitter diplomatic spats with the now deceased Khwarazm-Shah Tekish almost threatened all out war with the newly born regional power. Tekish’s son also has his sights set on putting the Caliphate under his control, and the former ally of the Caliphate in the East, the Ghurid Sultanate, has broken into all-out civil war following the death of Sultan Muhammad. -Brian Henn	true

Despite the fall of Roman authority in the West, Venice kept its ties to its overlord, profiting from its eroding authority and gaining much autonomy when the Exarchate of Ravenna fell. From its own particular circumstances arose a true Republic, where wealthy merchant-princes rule as a group, and new institutions were created. The Doge, an elected ruler by the council, became a central figure, with extensive powers, allowing cunning individuals, such as Enrico Dandolo, to extend the Venetian sphere of influence when the occasion arose. At the dawn of the 13th century, the strong merchant city of Venice ascended to an imperial status following the Fourth Crusade, establishing the Latin Empire as a client state from the ashes of the Roman Empire of the Komnenoi in 1204 and numerous colonies on the Eastern Mediterranean. With an extensive, experienced and mobile navy, the leading Venetian seafarers of the century established lucrative trade routes across the Adriatic, Mediterranean and Black Sea. After generations of dominating the seas, traversing the mediterranean and culling pirate threats - today’s Venice stands strong, so long as they assiduously protect their island cities.

Eric’s father King Canute I died in 1195 whilst his sons were still in their youth. However, the throne was passed over to Sverker Karlsson from the house of Sverker possibly due to the influence of a powerful individual, Jarl Birger Brosa. After the death of Birger Brosa, the deceased king's sons and their supporters made their claim to the throne but King Sverker did not oblige and the brothers had to escape to Norway.The brothers returned to Sweden in 1205 with Norwegian backing but were defeated by King Sverker and all three of Eric’s brothers were killed. Eric survived the onslaught and escaped back to Norway to plan his next move. In 1208 Eric returned again with Norwegian backing and this time overwhelmingly defeated the Swedish King backed by Danish troops in the Battle of Lena with King Sverker escaping to Denmark. After the battle, Eric took the name of King of Sweden.Sverker was not willing to give up his throne without a fight however and applied for an intervention by the Pope. The Pope ordered three bishops to persuade Eric to come to terms with Sverker or face serious consequences. These persuasion attempts failed however and in 1210 Sverker invaded Sweden in an attempt to reconquer the throne. Sverker’s and Eric’s forces met in the Battle of Gestilren. This time Sverker did not manage to Escape and was killed by a party led by one of Eric’s Jarls and thus the war was over.Only at the age of around 30, King Eric had managed to formulate a network of followers in a short time without the support of the Church and managed to defeat troops from Denmark, the major Scandinavian power at the time. After the victory at the Battle of Gestilren, King Eric quickly reconciled with the Danish king as well as the Catholic Church and even married a Danish princess to better the relations between the two Scandinavian kingdoms.The beginning of Eric’s reign was stormy to say the least, being in a struggle for the throne, at war with the Kingdom of Denmark and at odds with the Church.As the rainy days passing and light start shining through the clouds, what great destiny shall Sweden step into?

His greatest ally, and a longtime friend and mentor, Toghrul, Ong of the Keraite confederation, the most significant power amongst the Mongols, turned on him, as did his blood brother Jamukha, leading to a direct and bloody confrontation which left Temujin as the dominant ruler of the Mongol groups. After finishing the unification of the Mongol tribes, Genghis Khan then turned on the states to the South, sweeping aside the Western Xia before engaging in war against the mighty Jin dynasty, the Jurchen dynasty ruling Northern China. In 1211, he inflicted the first major defeat of the Jin and the doors now lay open for conquest in China. However, a Naiman prince, Kuchlug, has been gaining power amongst the Qara Khitai, and inevitably, Genghis Khan’s eyes turn towards Central Asia, where he hopes to finish off his rival and put the Khitai threat to rest. Such a campaign will inevitably bring Mongol armies to the doorstep of the Khwarazmian empire and of the Cuman-Kipchak confederacy. His sons, Jochi, Chagatai, Ögedei and Tolui, all look to take advantage to carve out their own appanage as the Mongol horde takes over the rich lands surrounding the steppes.	true

A group of nomadic pastoralists from Khwarazm, the Seljuk migrated into Iran and took it by force at the head of a large Turkmen confederation. Once the Near East had been consolidated under strong Seljuk leadership in Iran, the perennial raids from the Turkish tribesmen led to direct conflict with the Roman emperor, whose army fell at Manzikert in 1071, paving the way for Turkish conquest in Anatolia. Following the traditional assignment of land as apanages of the Turks, the Seljuks of Rum consolidated power in Anatolia, increasing their prestige and pressing the neighbouring Christians. The assassination of Malik-Shah, Sultan of the Great Seljuks, in 1092 proved to be an opportune event for the Sultan of Rum, as the chaos that erupted gave him, like many in the disintegrating Great Seljuk realm, the opportunity to carve out their own independent realm, free from Seljuk politics in Iran. The freedom was short-lived, as Crusaders from beyond the sea to help the resurgent empire under the Komnenoi and inflicted several setbacks. Now after a century of back and forth with the Romans, Franks and Georgians, the Seljuk realm is firmly on the edge of both collapse and greatness. Internal politics threatens the very stability of the realm as the untimely death of Sultan Kaikusrau against the greatly weakened Romans in 1211 has pitted the ambitions of the Seljuk princes against each other and thrust Sultan Kaikaus in a very fragile situation. However, the Romans are scattered and weak, and Europe stands open to the ambitions of any Turk who can unite the unruly tribes of Anatolia.	true

Laying claim to be the successor of the Byzantine Empire, the Empire of Epirus has become a new home to many refugees from Constantinople, Thessaly, and the Peloponnese. Emperor Doukas has recognized the authority of Pope Innocent III, upsetting the Eastern Orthodox Church, and must look to the papacy for support as factions over the mountains to the East, such as the newly established Latin Empire and the Empire of Nicaea seek to become the dominant regional power. To the North lies the equally ambitious Grand Duchy of Serbia and the a growing Tsardom of Bulgaria. The Emperor will need to use his neighbours’ distaste for each other to his advantage and to strike quickly at the vulnerable Latin lordships if the Empire of Epirus is to become a great power. -Lucca Markese	true

For the Visigoths, this meant a kingdom that sat astride the Pyrenees, in both Hispania and Gaul, with their capital at Toulouse.\\n\\nSince then, they have been at war with the highly-aggressive, expansionist Franks to the north, their Burgundian allies, and the Suebi in the northwest corner of Hispania. Now, in AD533, the only Gallic territory still under Visigothic control is the southern province of Septimania, under constant threat of attack from the Franks. Yet war has also raged away from the battlefield; much of the Visigoths’ trouble has been exacerbated by internal instability, and brothers have killed brothers for the throne. In addition, the Ostrogoths have had a controlling interest in the affairs of their neighbours and kin for some time, Theoderic the Great even installing his grandson, Amalaric as king in AD511. \\n\\nSince his death, Theudis – Theoderic’s loyal swordbearer and a man of common birth - has been elected king, marrying a local noblewoman and treating the largely-Romanised population fairly and justly to strengthen his position at home, and raising an army independent of Ostrogothic influence. His goals are thus: to recapture the territory lost in Gaul to Clovis’ Franks and to consolidate the Visigoths’ holdings in Hispania, and if the Vandal Kingdom collapses under pressure from the Romans there may be land for the taking in northern Africa. Who knows, such things may even allow the Visigoths to control and dominate Mediterranean trade – making their kingdom far stronger than any before it!	true

As the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, the Mercians dominate the land south of the River Humber.\\n\\nIn the late 6th century AD, the five English shires of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire and Warwickshire were united under a single leader, giving rise to the Kingdom of Mercia. Creoda of the Iclingas is most often cited as the first Mercian ruler and the founder of its capital at Tamworth. Yet opinion on the issue is divided; the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not refer to him as a king and some scholars question if he was nothing more than the product of a monk's fevered imaginings!\\n\\nNevertheless, it is the Iclingas dynasty, beginning officially with the reign of Penda in approximately AD625, that has given rise to a period of untold stability. Although their line has been plagued by assassinations, betrayals and deaths in battle, the Iclingas have been able to expand Mercian borders to encompass most of the midlands and the south of England too.\\n\\nIn AD757, Offa became king, following a civil war in the wake of King Aethelbald's murder. Consolidating his midland provinces, he looks upon the southern kingdoms avariciously, desiring to bring them under Mercian control. Respected by the Franks across the channel, and rightly feared by Englishmen everywhere, Mercia is poised to become the single greatest power in the British Isles - a single, united kingdom under the rule of a mighty king!	true

During the fall of the Roman Empire, Asturian an identity was formed through their constant feuding between the rival Visigoths and Suebi. When the Umayyad Caliphate invaded Iberia in AD711, the Visigoths buckled; their king was betrayed and murdered, and the Muslim invaders stormed the south of the Peninsula, almost wiping out the remainder of the Visigothic aristocracy. Yet a surviving nobleman, Pelagio, fled to Asturias, where he began to resist the Caliphate, leading Christian forces to victory over the Muslims at the Battle of Covadonga in AD722; a turning point in the struggle - essentially the beginning of the Reconquista. Pelagio's resultant power structure endured, lasting until after his death in AD737. His successors, Alphonse and Fruela, extended Asturian borders further. This period was also known for the construction of splendid Asturian architecture, with basilicas and monuments appearing across the region. Fruela, nevertheless, was known as ""the Cruel"" after he assassinated his brother in order to gain total control.\\n\\nNow, Fruela's cruel hubris has earned, in turn, his death at the hands of a disgruntled cousin, Aurelius, who has ascended to the throne in his place.

start_pos_factions_description_2120158606	The Kingdom of Georgia since its founding has gone through many trials by fire.  Immediately after the reunification of 1008, the Georgian state found itself caught between a stalking Byzantine eagle from the southwest and a leaping Seljuk tiger from the southeast. The Georgians first lost to the Byzantines at Svindax in 1022 and were forced to cede territory and hostages to maintain their territorial integrity. When those same Byzantines were dealt a crushing defeat at Manzikert, the Georgians retook the ceded territory, but were promptly invaded and subjugated by the Seljuk victors in 1080, who forced the nascent kingdom to pay an annual tribute. Into this calamity came David IV, known as “The Builder,” who raised a peasant militia against the Seljuks in 1089, and, taking advantage of the First Crusade 7 years later, fragmented the foreign holdings and began to recapture them one by one. David had united the vast majority of Georgia by 1100 and steadily pushed out the Turkish invaders, finally breaking all Seljuk control by seizing Tbilisi in 1122. For the next two years, David continued to attack southwards, also gaining the title of King of the Armenians by 1124. Domestically, David also settled 40,000 Kipchak warriors on farmlands in his kingdom, thus gaining the services of the King of Alania, and invited a wide variety of western mercenaries to assist him in his campaigns against the Muslims. By the time of his death in 1125, David had produced a stable kingdom. 60 years later, Queen Tamar took the throne, and continued her ancestor’s legacy. When Constantinople fell to the Latins, Georgia became the strongest Christian state east of Bulgaria. Taking the initiative, Tamar quickly seized a portion of the Black Sea coastline and invited her relative Alexios Komnenos to become its ruler; in doing so, she had founded the Empire of Trebizond, and made it directly dependent on Georgian interests. By 1210, Georgia had reached its historical territorial apex, and ushered in a Golden Age. It is now 1212 AD, and the Kingdom of Georgia is ruled by Tamar’s son, Georgi IV. The kingdom has never been stronger, and the natural barrier of the Caucuses is still a powerful deterrent to invasions. Look to the west to find your next moves; friendly Trebizond still stands on the Black sea coast, and other Christians still hold the Holy Land against the Saracens. Ensure that you remain on good terms with your religious brethren, and always support them in their endeavors, for they will support you in return. Finally, maintain a careful eye on the East.

As the Reconquista reaches its final stage, with the expulsion of the Almohad dynasty from their last footholds in southern Iberia, Portugal must deal with the shifting relations of this land. Its alignment may swing the balance of power, given its independence from the squabbling of the intermarried households of Leon, Castille and Aragon. Afonso inherits a capable people, bound in unity by their faith and independence. With his backs to the sea, making a land grab for what is left of the Moorish footholds to the south may allow Portugal to sweep back over its Catholic neighbours and deliver a killing blow. An alliance beyond the Pyrenees may prove fruitful for Afonso too. While the Iberian Peninsula may seem far off in the distance, it holds a perfect staging post for conquering the rich lands of north Africa, or perhaps spilling the blood of fellow Christians once the Peninsula is firmly in one’s grasp.

Defensible thanks to their separation from the mainland, subjugating or conquering the rest of the isles leaves nothing but benefits to a shrewd ruler. The Angevins, having ascended to the throne under Geoffrey of Anjou and his wife, Matilda, reached the peak of their power in 1151 after their son Henry II’s marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine granted them the political and martial strength to force the King Stephen of England to name Henry as his heir 1153, which allowed him to effectively rule England, and have the title officially bestowed upon Henry in 1154 following Stephen’s death. This granted the new King not only the throne of England, but also gave him rule over Aquitaine, Normandy, and Rouen. Eleanor gave birth to two sons of equal fame and notoriety. Richard I, a great warrior and beloved King, and John I. By now however, England has seen better days. Scots and Irish to the north contemplate revolt, and the nobles have lost faith in their King. Once the pinnacle of feudal achievement led by previous Angevin kings, King John the First has neglected his duties for more frivolous and greedy pursuits. The younger brother of King Richard The Lionheart, he ruled in all but name whilst his brother partook in the Third Crusade, spending all but six months of his reign away from the throne. And, fortuitously for John, Richard would never return from his crusade, instead dying whilst besieging a French Castle at Chalûs, of gangrene from a crossbow wound in April of 1199. Since then, the upstart French Capetian Dynasty has become emboldened by John’s mishandling of his nobles and took the opportunity to take back lost holdings. After numerous and humiliating defeats, John I was dishonored with the moniker “John Lackland” for the loss of his birthrights.

Still seated in Constantinople since the days of Constantine, and leading the Christian people in the East, the Emperors enjoyed great prosperity and respect despite numerous setbacks, maintaining still the Glory of Rome in a new age. The Komnenos dynasty, who oversaw a great resurgence in imperial power late in the 11th century, has been deposed and the Angelos dynasty took the throne near the end of the 12th century. Greed and lust for power by the Angeloi caused the Empire to open itself to internal and external enemies. The first Emperor of the dynasty, Isaac II, was blinded and cast away into a cell by his ambitious brother Alexios III who obtained the throne for himself. Serious misgovernment and ill-treatment of the people lead to the Turks regaining land that the Komnenoi reconquered from the invaders. The deposed ex-Emperor's son Alexios IV asked the crusaders for assistance in regaining the throne. He promised gold, silver, as well as men and ships for their crusade to Egypt. By 1203, they had reached Constantinople and demanded Alexios III to give up the throne. When he declined, the first siege begun. After Roman setbacks, Alexios III fled the city, leaving Alexios IV to be crowned co-Emperor by his father's side. Alexios III's short reign had the city divided between both factions, and Alexios Doukas, a high court official, rose up and overthrew both Isaac II and Alexios IV, casting them in prison where they finally perished. Since the agreement with the crusaders was shattered, they besieged the city for a second time and eventually overcame the defenders. Constantinople, the city of the world’s desire, was viciously sacked and the Empire was partitioned. The last remnants of the Romans were scattered in Nicaea, Epirus and Trebizond. Theodore I Laskaris, rose to the throne in Nicaea, rallying the most significant part of the Roman nobility, and lead several counter attacks against the new Latin Empire and thwarting a major Seljuk invasion, killing the Sultan Kaikusrau in 1211. The truce that was signed following this significant victory could possibly buy enough time for Theodore to throw his strength at the Komnenoi in Trebizond and the Latins on the Anatolian coast. The true objective, however, will always be to send the Latins back to the sea, and to sit triumphant in the ancient capital of Constantinople. -AnTMaN	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120156908	The Ostrogothic Kingdom has succeeded where the Romans failed. The Battle of Ravenna in AD476 - Rome's final humiliation - signalled the ignoble end of its Western Empire. In its place was the Kingdom of Italy, helmed by the victorious Germanic general, Flavius Odoacer. By AD493 the Ostrogothic king, Theoderic the Great, backed by the Eastern Romans, murdered Odoacer at a banquet and assumed control of the region. Although his rule was benevolent, Theoderic's death in AD526 destabilised his kingdom, as his grandson - still a child - ascended to the throne. Now, the murder of the young king's pro-Roman mother has given Emperor Justinian the 'casus belli' he needs to reconquer Italy and reclaim the ancient seat of Imperial power. So, the future of the Ostrogoths remains uncertain - but no Roman will wrest this hard-won land from their iron grasp without a fight!	true

Formerly subjects of the Great Liao, the Mongol tribes fractured into a number of confederations once the Liao fell to the rising power of the Jurchen. Temujin, a Mongol of noble blood, led a difficult childhood, including the murder of his father and his capture and enslavement, before he grew into a great leader. Through sheer force of will and great cunning, Temujin maneuvered through tribal politics and managed to gain significant power amongst the Mongol tribes. His greatest ally, and a longtime friend and mentor, Toghrul, Ong of the Keraite confederation, the most significant power amongst the Mongols, turned on him, as did his blood brother Jamukha, leading to a direct and bloody confrontation which left Temujin as the dominant ruler of the Mongol groups. After finishing the unification of the Mongol tribes, Genghis Khan then turned on the states to the South, sweeping aside the Western Xia before engaging in war against the mighty Jin dynasty, the Jurchen dynasty ruling Northern China. In 1211, he inflicted the first major defeat of the Jin and the doors now lay open for conquest in China. However, a Naiman prince, Kuchlug, has been gaining power amongst the Qara Khitai, and inevitably, Genghis Khan’s eyes turn towards Central Asia, where he hopes to finish off his rival and put the Khitai threat to rest. Such a campaign will inevitably bring Mongol armies to the doorstep of the Khwarazmian empire and of the Cuman-Kipchak confederacy. His sons, Jochi, Chagatai, Ögedei and Tolui, all look to take advantage to carve out their own appanage as the Mongol horde takes over the rich lands surrounding the steppes.	true

Having fled across Europe from the relentless Huns and the freezing weather, they found relative safety in the west. Later, they watched as Emperor Justinian attempted to reclaim Italy from the Ostrogoths. Seeing opportunity, the Lombards overthrew the meagre Roman garrison, establishing a capital at Pavia in AD572. After that, most of northern and central Italy fell under Lombard control whilst the Imperial remnants, known as the Exarchate of Ravenna, clung to the coastlines.\\n\\nThe Romans were able to survive because the Lombards languished in a power vacuum for a decade. However, when Autari was subsequently crowned king, a new era of unprecedented peace was ushered in, enabling him to consolidate royal power hitherto held by the powerful, virtually autonomous Lombard dukes.\\n\\nNow, Desiderius has ascended to the Lombard throne, inheriting a powerful kingdom that faces fresh new challenges. Civil unrest and aristocratic dissent are brewing, whilst the Papal states grow bolder with backing from the ever-hungry Franks.

For centuries, they were defined by the aggressive nature of their society, but until now, Scandinavian relations with the rest of the world have been primarily peaceful - defined by the unusual trading reach their superior vessels have provided them. But now, as the Christian world, led by Charlemagne, seeks to choke the life out of paganism, the Danes will lead the counterattack.

The Burgundians gradually became a powerful vassal of the French dynasty. Burgundy's fortune changed under Hugh III. The Burgundians soon got involved in conflicts with Louis VII of France in the 1160s and 1170s. Upon the ascension of Philip II Augustus in 1180, Hugh forced several men to support Burgundy. Philip soon invaded Burgundy in 1186. The Burgundians were forced to sign a humiliating peace and Hugh paid a ransom for the release of his son and heir, Odo. He also gave up any ambitions of taking France. Hugh changed the capital of Burgundy to Dijon in 1187 and made it an economic and commercial centre. Hugh participated in the Third Crusade, alongside his former enemy, Philip Augustus. Hugh died shortly afterwards during the Siege of Acre in August 1192. His successor was his son Odo who became Odo III. Odo reversed Hugh's anti-French policies and fought alongside Philip Augustus during the Battle of Bouvines in 1214.

A group of nomadic pastoralists from Khwarazm, the Seljuk migrated into Iran and took it by force at the head of a large Turkmen confederation. Once the Near East had been consolidated under strong Seljuk leadership in Iran, the perennial raids from the Turkish tribesmen led to direct conflict with the Roman emperor, whose army fell at Manzikert in 1071, paving the way for Turkish conquest in Anatolia. Following the traditional assignment of land as apanages of the Turks, the Seljuks of Rum consolidated power in Anatolia, increasing their prestige and pressing the neighbouring Christians. The assassination of Malik-Shah, Sultan of the Great Seljuks, in 1092 proved to be an opportune event for the Sultan of Rum, as the chaos that erupted gave him, like many in the disintegrating Great Seljuk realm, the opportunity to carve out their own independent realm, free from Seljuk politics in Iran. The freedom was short-lived, as Crusaders from beyond the sea to help the resurgent empire under the Komnenoi and inflicted several setbacks. Now after a century of back and forth with the Romans, Franks and Georgians, the Seljuk realm is firmly on the edge of both collapse and greatness. Internal politics threatens the very stability of the realm as the untimely death of Sultan Kaikusrau against the greatly weakened Romans in 1211 has pitted the ambitions of the Seljuk princes against each other and thrust Sultan Kaikaus in a very fragile situation. However, the Romans are scattered and weak, and Europe stands open to the ambitions of any Turk who can unite the unruly tribes of Anatolia.	true

It sent the people into worry about what would happen next, especially since Nemanja saw fit to pass the throne to his middle son Stefan and not the eldest, Vukan. The land spiraled into civil war and although beaten at first, Stefan would regain the throne from his older brother with the help of the Bulgarians. This however meant little in the terms of relations with Serbia's eastern neighbor. The drums of war rage between the bitter rivals and the large piles of the dead did little to prevent Serbia from pursuing yet another war, this time for supremacy of the Peninsula. The young Stefan is ambitious, truly more then any other Zhupan that has come before him, perhaps even more then Nemanja himself. Stefan hopes to finally defeat Serbia's bitter rival in the East and more importantly to make Serbia into a proper Kingdom. In order to do this, he needs the support of a strong religious leader. The Eastern church however does not seem willing, the Byzantine church prevents the Serbs from gaining patriarchal authority and Byzantium itself has stopped Serbia's spread to its south. There may yet be an opportunity to obtain a crown from the Catholic pope, who is looking to gain influence in the Balkans following the break between the Latin and Orthodox Church over a century ago. The Zhupan is beset by petty rivalry of the Serbian nobles that has plagued the land for generations. The nobles are loyal while the Bulgarian lion roars to its West but this is the only thing keeping them united. The greatest challenge for the young Zhupan will not be to defeat his bitter rival but to rather keep the rebellious and disloyal aristocracy aligned to his people and under his grip. If the Zhupan succeeds, Serbia's destiny to rule the Balkans will be ever closer. -Aleksa Šuković	true
