advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664523	The enemy have won the day, Chieftain! We must fall back and regroup!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665423	Remember that help and advice is available as we advance into battle, Chieftain. Learn to rely upon it.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663222	Loyalty is a measure of a character's devotion to the ruling party of his faction. It can be increased through political actions as well as character skills, positive traits or household members. Negative traits or events may reduce loyalty. Should it reach zero he will start a civil war, potentially causing other characters to defect to his cause.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664922	The late Emperor Theodosius decreed that Rome be divided, entrusting you with the bountiful east. Now, the Empire is in danger: the Hunnic hordes are approaching from the northeast, driving even the hardiest of barbarian tribes to flee before them. The Visigoths and their ilk migrate across your lands: they cannot be allowed to harm your people! Be mindful too of your southeastern territories; the Sassanid Empire is strong and will challenge you for dominion of the east. The west is guarded by the Western Romans, but they too are overstretched and under threat of barbarian invasion. It may be prudent to unite Rome under your banner and restore the Empire to her former glory!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665222	Word of the Roman attack has been sent to our cavalry forces. They will surely return to the battlefield soon. We must hold out until then!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665922	General Belisarius has been hurt in the fighting and carried from the field! His loss will be keenly felt!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666022	And to the east, vicious men seeking blood and plunder cast voracious eyes upon your shores - be ever vigilant of the Viking Danes.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1387459530	Outflanking forces can be turned into fixing forces. If you commit a large outflanking force and do not attack from the front, the enemy will be forced to turn and face you, presenting his flanks to what was your centre.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658422	If your party becomes too powerful, mistrust and paranoia ultimately lead to a challenge for control of your faction. At this point, [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0037_enc_page_campaign_play_faction_politics#enc_text_politics_civil_war]]civil war[[/url]] ensues; the remaining parties unite and lead rebel forces to capture the capital and overthrow your regime. Similarly, should you be deemed too weak, you may be exiled as an enemy of the state. 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664021	We are beaten, fall back to the town! Let us hope the enemy show us mercy!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664621	Enemy forces have crossed into our territory, Chieftain!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665021	Defeat! The pagans carry the field! What is God's plan for us now?	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665521	The noblemen of your court grow in stature as the seasons pass. Be sure to keep an eye on their development.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665621	Send a missile unit into melee by selecting it, then pressing Alt + right-click on the target unit.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1170317847	A closely-packed mass of troops is a superb target for missile units on the battlefield. Keep pounding them and they'll take casualties!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664620	The Vandals block the road ahead. Let us attack!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665120	Bonds forged between men in battle are not easily broken. Your army is becoming a force to be reckoned with. Be sure to guide its development to your benefit, Chieftain.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666120	Victory in the east would also enable you to reconnect with your Frankish allies, who share no love for Islam and have bested it once before.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666220	Beyond them is the Spanish Peninsula. Though far from these shores, its lands are rich with potential plunder and promise.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658024	Missions may be reviewed on the objectives panel. Although there is no penalty for failing, successful completion of a mission results in a reward, often in the form of bonus effects. If a mission cannot be completed due to factors outside of your control it will be cancelled.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664727	We can move our people south of the Danube river, behind the Roman frontier. The Huns would be unlikely to attack us there. The land is fertile, the people are rich and the possibilities for expansion are plenty.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1212661715	Ordering the whole army to attack throws away any chance of gaining an advantage. Even if you have enough brute force to win, you will have lost many more men than you needed to.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2045097248	Repression is the enforcement of your rule by the presence of garrison troops and a useful tool for keeping populations in [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0044a_enc_page_campaign_play_province_public_order]]order[[/url]].	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2047305771	This option demands that a faction becomes your puppet or tributary state, taking advantage of your military might in exchange for a percentage of their income and, in the case of puppet states, unlimited military access. However, puppet states may find themselves dragged into a conflict not of their own design. Unlike a regular ally, they cannot decline a request to assist when war is declared on their overlord without automatically declaring war themselves.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664126	The enemy forces must be defeated, but the capture of the town is our ultimate goal. Head for the central plaza!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664326	Chieftain, the right weather can be the difference between victory and defeat. The choice of when to attack is yours to make.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664626	The Vandals hold firm, we are defeated! Regroup at the coast!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664726	The time has come for us to make difficult decisions, Chieftain. The Huns attack here in numbers too great for us to repel. We must leave this place if we are to survive as an independent people.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664826	The enemy march across our borders, Chieftain!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665126	Request permission from the Romans to cross the Danube into their lands, Chieftain. A deal can surely be done.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665326	Represented by the ruined building icons on the campaign map, deserted regions contain the ruins of settlements that have been abandoned. You may encounter reduced fertility around recently desolated settlements, but also resource-rich areas around those areas reclaimed by nature over time.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664025	You abandoned our position, and for what? To defend some barren hilltop while the enemy burn our houses? What kind of strategy is this? We are lost!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664625	The blockade has been crushed, the Vandals have been swept aside! Onwards to Carthage, soldiers!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664725	The war with the Huns will be hard-fought. We should consider expanding the range of military options at our disposal. Agents can be hired to support our forces, or to strike against the enemy.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665825	As a settlement becomes damaged in battle, the defenders will begin to lose heart. You can view the effects on their morale by hovering over the settlement damage icon, to the right of battle balance-bar. Buildings can now be specifically targeted for destruction, and flaming shots from archers and artillery have a good chance of setting structures ablaze, subject to weather conditions of course.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658427	As your campaign progresses, growth enables surplus population to accumulate in your settlements, enabling them to [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0045_enc_page_campaign_play_province_construction]]expand[[/url]]. Certain buildings will improve that rate of [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0044_enc_page_campaign_play_province_regions#enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_provinces_growth]]growth[[/url]].	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660224	After grouping units you have the opportunity to hand that group over to AI control. In this case they are given a set of basic instructions, such as attacking a certain unit or defending a specific position. If an AI-controlled group destroys its target it will defend its current position until given further orders.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663924	A compatible Touch device has been detected. Touch controls can be used to move the camera, give orders to units on the battlefield, control armies on the campaign map, navigate through menus and much more. An on screen keyboard can be activated via the option in the controls menu. For more information, please click [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0005_enc_page_help_keyboard_shortcuts]]here[[/url]] to view the Touch controls page in the encyclopaedia.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664424	The enemy come forward to meet us, Chieftain! We must meet them in battle, or withdraw!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665524	Our siege continues according to plan. The enemy defences begin to crumble, Chieftain!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664429	One of our units has rallied and is ready to fight again, Chieftain! They are battered, but not beaten!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664829	Victory is ours, Chieftain! The fate of the men captured in battle is yours to decide. It can be beneficial to hold them, but sometimes leniency or brutality can be worth more.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665429	Chieftain, a word in your ear: despite the war going on around us, there are always ambitious men who would seek to profit at the misfortune of others. Be sure to keep an eye on the political situation at home.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666029	The Lombards have endured for centuries against hardship, emerging ever stronger. Italy is in upheaval, however, and you must rise to meet the dangers head-on.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666129	The land may have been burned to deny the invaders any real purchase, but you must nevertheless push back and reclaim it for yourselves.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664128	Your general can sway this battle, Chieftain! His word can rally and inspire the men before you. Use his influence!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665928	The enemy have entered the city, commander! They must be stopped!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666028	Despite these challenges, control of the isles shall be yours - take up your sword and make Mercia great!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666328	The Garamantian claim is strong, and our will even stronger. Beyond Rome is the world, and should the Garamantians not aspire to such greatness? Go forth in our name, and seize glory!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1649185866	Terrain has an effect on a unit's movement speed. Sticking to roads or short grass will ensure your units move at maximum speed.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663933	Terrible news! Aetius has fallen! Our men will lose the courage to fight when they hear!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664333	Petrodava is ours! We can take our revenge against its people, finally! Loot the town, and the world will see that the Visigoths will not be rolled over.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664533	This battle is lost, Chieftain! We must leave the field while we still can!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1247116376	When the enemy have a lot of fast, light troops or cavalry, consider moving your light infantry and skirmishers closer to other supporting units, so they don't get caught in the open.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663932	The Huns advance, commander! Battle is upon us!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658532	An [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0022_enc_page_campaign_play_military_ambush]]ambush[[/url]] is a sneak attack on a passing army. The usual rules for deployment do not apply here: your forces will attack the enemy whilst they are in marching order. This is not always the best option to take in every situation. The enemy army will not be able to move until the battle begins, so deploy carefully to cause maximum confusion and disorder. 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660231	When they join you in a war, a war target can be designated for all your allies, tributary states, puppet states, etc. - although there is a chance they may not mobilise against it. Over time, you may receive similar missions from your allies in return.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664231	The recruits will begin their training immediately. The price of their training and upkeep will be met from the treasury. Do not let such matters concern you at present: if we are to die, let us fight them all the way. Hang the expense!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664631	Olbia is lost! Chieftain, our spiritual home has been taken by the enemy. Confidence in your leadership has dried up; your people no longer follow your commands. I would advise you to escape before soldiers are sent after you.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665231	Word reaches us that Emperor Valens himself has fallen in the fighting! His men will surely flee when they hear!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665731	Hordes are formidable, as they represent the agricultural, economic and recruitment potential of a city, combined with the mobility and might of an army. This also makes them vulnerable however – lose a horde in battle, and you also lose a major cog in your faction infrastructure.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665931	The enemy retreat is in disarray! The battle is ours!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666231	"You represent the bold vanguard of the mighty Hephthalite Empire. While your countrymen wage a fierce war against the Gupta Empire in the east, your armies sweep westwards in a never ending search for new lands to conquer and new wealth to acquire. To the south awaits the Sassanid Empire, backed by its numerous allies and puppets. Undoubtedly, your path towards the Persian heartland will be arduous, as this most fertile of regions will not be given up without a fight. However, tensions with the Eastern Roman Empire occupy the minds of the Sassanid rulers; use this to your advantage and strike whilst their backs are turned. These lands are full of enemies, go forth and vanquish them, let all know the strength of the ""White Huns""!"	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663230	Ministerial offices and commissions can be awarded to generals in your faction when they reach a certain age or rank. Loyalty and influence are both increased by this, meaning offices can be used to placate useful but potentially dangerous individuals.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664930	Hailing from the eastern steppes, yours is a life of constant movement and conflict. Your arrival has driven many from their homelands in fear: the Goths have fled south-westwards, give chase and you will find the fertile lands of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Vandals run west: there you will find the Western Roman Empire, weaker than its eastern cousin but perhaps easier to exploit. Southeast lies the wealthy Sassanid Empire, ripe for plundering. Before you take on these supposed masters of the civilised world, you will do well to strengthen your position by subjugating the northern tribes. The world will dance to your tune, or it will burn!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665130	Our facilities in this town are damaged. Key buildings must be kept in a good state of repair if we are to benefit from the services they provide.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665230	Our cavalry returns, Chieftain! Put them to work against the Romans, quickly!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665330	You can choose to take over an uninhabited settlement simply by engaging it with your force. Alongside the financial cost required to rebuild it from the ground up, colonisers also provide the required manpower, who stay on as the population of the new territory. Migrating barbarians can also colonise deserted regions.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665530	Excellent! The additional manpower will be useful in the battles to come.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665730	Worship of the great god Godan has left its mark on the Langobards - your name and even your appearance pays tribute to his wisdom. Like him, you will have to rely on wit and diplomacy to compensate for your inferior power in these troubled times. Already your silver tongue has earned the approval of your Germanic neighbours; all you need do is pick the mightiest ally. The Franks, to the north, are powerful and well-disposed to you, as are the neighbouring Alamans. In order to demonstrate your worth, consider eradicating the Vandals that pillage these lands. At the end of the road, a great prize beckons: Godan has revealed the coming of a great Langobard empire – in Rome!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666230	You stand on the precipice of glory everlasting; take the Vikings to war!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1216301252	You have selected a target outside the highlighted area. This means your character cannot reach its target this turn. Provided that an enemy does not block their path they will continue the journey during the next turn.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664237	We must seek ways to improve our methods of war if we are to survive the coming battles. Let us put men to work on improving our knowledge and tactics.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665337	The fertility of a province determines the yield of its food supplies, as well as the income received from agriculture and food production. Be wary that the razing and desolation of neighbouring regions within a province can affect its overall fertility, as can climate change and seasonal effects.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665637	To target an entire area for bombardment select your artillery, then press Alt + right-click on the ground you wish to bombard.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660136	An army's [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0018_enc_page_campaign_play_military_stances]]stance[[/url]] represents how its capabilities change under a number of situations, including [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0017_enc_page_campaign_play_military_recruit]]recruitment[[/url]], marching, laying [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0021_enc_page_campaign_play_military_sieges]]siege[[/url]] or ambush, and making camp. Each one costs a number of action points to execute and once entered, the army will stay in that stance until given a different order. It is not possible for an army to enter a stance when on a transport ship at sea.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665736	A horde on the move can be a force to be reckoned with, but even the hardiest warriors must rest and recuperate. Hover the cursor over the encampment icon in the stances menu to see its many benefits, which include buffs to the horde’s troop replenishment, income, population growth, army integrity, and immunity from attrition. For a horde in deep winter, this can be the difference between life and death.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1213263346	Remember that the goal here is to capture the [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0084_enc_page_battle_play_phase_conflict_sieges]]settlement[[/url]], not destroy it! To achieve victory either kill or rout the entire army, or capture the central plaza. Before you begin, ensure that any siege weapons are positioned close enough to target the enemy defences.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664635	Petrodava has fallen! Refugees stream away from the city in droves. How can you have let this happen, Chieftain? You are to be banished for your failures. Perhaps you will find more success as a farmer, hah!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664935	Your people are divided, compelled to flee by the violent arrival of the Huns from the east. You may choose to resettle your people as soon as possible, but this is an excellent time to start anew. To the west lie fertile Roman lands ready for the taking; to the southeast, the empire of the Sassanids and their subjects possess great riches yet to be plundered. Consolidate and conquer, or continue migrating both west and eastward before you settle and maximise your options. The choice is yours, but one way or another the great Alan people will prevail! 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665135	The Ostrogoths sue for peace, Chieftain. We should consider their offer carefully in the face of the Hunnic attack.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665435	We will shortly be engaging the enemy, Chieftain! Be sure to deploy each crew according to their strengths.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665835	In battle, consider the enemy’s morale as a target in itself. By stacking morale penalties against units, you can cause routs and conclude the battle with fewer losses. Powerful morale debuffs include flank and rear attacks on enemy units, the scare trait carried by certain specialist units, the death of a general which creates an army-wide panic shockwave, whistling arrows, and a general’s warcry. The biggest morale-shock you can bring a unit is to slaughter 50% of its number in under 60 seconds. 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665935	This battle is lost! Fall back, men! Fall back!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666135	The Spanish Peninsula will be wholly Christian once again. Descend from the mountains and wash the invaders into the sea, with Christ at the head of your armies!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1264671506	Your faction could be making more money through [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0046_enc_page_campaign_play_province_trade_finance]]trade[[/url]]. Use [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0038_enc_page_campaign_play_faction_diplomacy]]diplomacy[[/url]] to make new trade agreements.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664334	Eugenius and his men block our route, commander! Battle is upon us!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664734	The Romans seem unwilling to grant us access to their lands, Chieftain. Perhaps we should ask again, this time sweetening the deal with coin?	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665134	The treasury is empty, Chieftain! Soldiers go unpaid, horses go hungry and buildings fall into disrepair! Something must be done before the men revolt against your leadership!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139657938	When a settlement reaches the top of its building chain and a particular event has occurred it may then be possible to construct a [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0045_enc_page_campaign_play_province_construction# enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_legendary]]legendary[[/url]] building. Once built it cannot be destroyed under any circumstances. If your faction is the first to construct one it will be awarded a permanent faction [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0041_enc_page_campaign_play_faction_traits_faction]]trait[[/url]] and its associated effects.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658438	Any units or ships that rout following a general's death will automatically become shattered.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658039	Farms, markets and ports supply food and settlements and certain [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0045_enc_page_campaign_play_province_construction]]buildings[[/url]] within them consume it. Although food is automatically distributed across your territory, if total consumption is not matched by production then food shortages can occur, which can lead to unrest and, ultimately, [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0044b_enc_page_campaign_play_province_public_order#enc_text_manual_public_order_rebellions]]rebellion[[/url]]. Make sure you keep food production buildings upgraded.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663139	In a tribal society or a monarchy, your tribe or family branch could be challenged should they be deemed weak, leading to civil war. Such conflicts can only continue for a limited time, at which point they are automatically resolved by treaty, the terms of which are decided by the balance of power at the point of resolution.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663339	The larger your settlements, the more food is consumed, so it is important to keep food producing buildings upgraded in tandem with the size of your settlement in order to avoid shortages.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664139	Word reaches us that the enemy commander has fallen in the melee! His warriors will surely lose heart!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664239	Ready your swords, the Romans approach! Leave no man alive!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664339	While lacking the glamour of battle, holding court on civic matters is a useful way to spend your time, Chieftain. Province management is essential if your kingdom is to remain stable.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664439	Once again, we do battle with the enemy! Present arms, men! Show them how a Visigoth fights!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665239	Valens is dead, and his army run for their lives! The future of the Gothic people is secure! Victory is ours!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666239	Your people, the Anteans, have descended - along with other Slavic tribes - to claim eastern Europe for themselves. However, it is clear that we are meant for greater things.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660238	If a faction's initial offer or demand isn’t quite what you had in mind you can use the counter-offer option to enable further negotiation to take place, rather than simply rejecting it.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664538	Watch out, Chieftain! Enemy reinforcements are approaching!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665538	A list of strategic objectives is maintained for you. Be sure to make use of it, Chieftain.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666038	Your control of the Italian Peninsula must be consolidated. Spoleto and Benevento must recognise your power, be it through subjugation or total destruction.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666338	Though hardship certainly awaits, you are poised to create a civilised Slavic identity that will endure the test of time. Your people are the children of the steppes, destined to inherit all of Europe!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1223289843	If simply left, damaged buildings will be automatically [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0045_enc_page_campaign_play_province_construction#enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_repair]]repaired[[/url]] very slowly over time at no cost. However, if a building is ruined you must select it and click on the repair button.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1242280643	There are many new [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0039_enc_page_campaign_play_faction_technology]]technologies[[/url]] to be researched that will assist your faction in its bid for [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0013_enc_page_campaign_play_objectives]]supremacy[[/url]]. To select one, open the technology panel via the dedicated button.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1245539238	Extremes of heat or cold will give a fatigue penalty to units not used to living and fighting in such conditions. Troops from those parts of the world are naturally resistant to this penalty.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664103	The Huns are driven off, Olbia is saved! The Ostrogoths shall pay for the damage they've caused, but tonight we celebrate!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664603	The people have revolted and taken up arms against our rule. Crush them!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665003	Our brave commander has fallen to the enemy! His loss will be keenly felt by the men!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666303	Centuries ago, Rome came to our doorstep, displacing our neighbours and snapping at our heels. Though we have exchanged some pleasantries since then, they nevertheless exist where they should not.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664602	Good! Now, let us see how the people of Petrodava respond to the olive branch we have offered.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664702	Our expansion brings us into contact with new peoples to the west, beyond the Carpathian mountains. With luck they will be well disposed to our cause.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665302	The longer a settlement is under siege, the worse its physical condition becomes, making it easier for the attacker to penetrate the defences.

Rome is divided and surrounded by enemies; there may never be a better time to reassert the natural order of Persian rule throughout Asia Minor and the Levant. Support for the Eastern Roman Empire and its religion is strong, so a steady approach may be wiser than a brute offensive.

Overstretched and desperately trying to protect the Western Empire from barbarian threat, the burden of military and civil maintenance has left your economy in tatters. Public order is waning so it may be wise to consolidate your forces closer to the capital, ceding frontier territories as a buffer if necessary.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664767	The Roman Empire remains powerful but is overstretched. They could surely use an ally like us. Constantinople is struggling against revolts in this area, and may welcome our support.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665867	You represent the last bastion of Pictish culture in Britannia. The Romans, masters of so much of the island, sought to cage you like dogs in the frozen north, but in so doing have sowed the seeds of their own downfall. The years of isolation and hardship have made your people savage; now they strain at the leash in their eagerness to feast on the dying empire beyond Hadrian’s Wall. The Ebdanians across the water, share your fervour and should flock to your banner. The neighbouring Caledonians, however, broken by years of war, may require galvanising into action.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666166	To the south, the Croats have crept in, attempting to undo your hard-fought Khaganate, whilst to the north other Slavic tribes press upon you, covetous of the fertile lands under Avar control. These encroachments cannot be tolerated.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139657866	As an alternative to straight-forward occupation, upon capture of a settlement there is also an option to loot it. Doing so adds a lump sum to your treasury, but there will be a greater public order penalty than that caused by occupation alone.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665365	Capture points inside a besieged settlement, such as gates, towers and plazas, give different advantages to the army controlling them. In order to take control of such positions units must stand next to them until the enemy’s banner is lowered and their own faction’s is raised. The greater the number of units gathered around a capture point, the sooner they will be able to acquire it. Cavalry do not need to be dismounted to do this.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665865	After many years spent wandering the shores and islands of the north, your people have finally found a land to call your own. The sting of the icy wind and the bite of the icy sea are still fresh in your memory and have strengthened your determination to overcome the hostile Vanarians. Securing the support of the neighbouring Rugians would surely tip the balance in your favour and enable you to vanquish your foes. However, your new land is infertile and resists cultivation: by sending an enterprising general south you may secure lands left vacant in the turmoil. A seed sown in such fertile soil may yet grow into a great city, and, with care, an empire.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665964	For many centuries your empire has flourished away from civilisation as the last great African kingdom. Now, however, the value of the Indian spice route has been truly realised, thrusting you into the limelight at last. Predictably, Rome courts you as an ally, pointing to your shared Christianity and the looming threat of the Himyarites across the water. You may rely on Roman support to cross the Red Sea and monopolise trade with the east, or you may reject their advances, turning back to the pagan routes that once sustained your kingdom. Perhaps then you could unite with other kingdoms in the region to drive the Romans from African shores once and for all. Your choice will shape your kingdom - make it well! 	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658369	Since diplomacy with and war against other factions can only be undertaken when your respective territories are adjacent, you can increase your line of sight by sending fleets further along the coast or agents into unknown lands to encounter new factions.

Whereas once you vied for control of the lucrative eastern trade ports, eventually your martial supremacy bent others to your will and created a kingdom combining only the very best elements of centuries of development. Across the water a threat to your kingdom blossoms – the newly-Christian Aksumite Empire has lately become aggressive, and their friendship with Rome goes from strength to strength. Ensure their designs on your territory do not become a reality by striking first!

The Great Conspiracy, an uprising of free tribes against the Roman invaders, was put down on your territory, ravaging your lands in the process. Now you are troubled by rumours that the Picts and the Ebdanians, your neighbours and brothers in blood, dream of reclaiming the isles in another British rebellion. You will have no part in it – looking instead across the seas for a new ally. The Saxons, smelling Rome’s weakness, hasten towards the east coast of Britannia.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665978	Although a new kingdom, your capital city, Hira, is renowned for its beauty, lauded as a wonder of Arabic culture, causing many tribes to unashamedly place themselves under your protection. The Sassanids, once your sworn foe, now count you as their most powerful strategic assets, no doubt due to your proximity to the Roman border. Only Rome’s Ghassanid allies prevent you from capturing the fertile settlements of the Mediterranean coast, and so must be dispatched as soon as possible. Seize these lands on the Sassanids’ behalf and consider converting to Zoroastrianism.

The key to this grand plan is control of the Mediterranean Sea to secure supply and trade routes, which will ensure the army is kept and the dream of a restored, united Empire maintained. However, the Vandal fleet is too powerful to attack head-on. Control of northern Africa must be decided on the battlefield before any hope of taking Rome can be entertained. Once Africa has been recovered we must turn our attention to the Ostrogothic usurpers who “rule” Italy. Great glory awaits he who delivers Rome into Roman hands once again!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666140	Since the old Frankish king - Pepin the Short - died, you have been able to raid his lands with relative impunity. However, that may soon change, so your people are in need of a powerful leader of their own.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660147	When you selected a faction, you also chose a family or party to represent within its political system. Your faction leader is the head of the party you chose. The influence of each party member affects its overall power. Winning battles as a general and completing construction projects as a governor may increase influence. The popularity of your party is the sum total of its members’ influence versus that of the opposing party.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665547	It is worth keeping watch on the health of our people, Chieftain. Disease has the potential to decimate our war effort.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665947	Theoderic’s death has left the Ostrogothic Kingdom in disarray. His grandson, King Athalaric, is still a child, and although his mother acts as regent, disgruntled family members plot and scheme behind the scenes - ready to take power at the flimsiest of opportunities. However, the Kingdom is also beset from without. Pressure from the Franks and Langobards has put its northern marches in danger, whilst the Roman East forever plans to take back its lost Empire. Yet, although we live in perilous times there is respite. The Romans have landed an expedition in Africa and taken the war to the Vandals. This might give us the opportunity to deal with the Frankish and Langobard incursions in the north before concentrating our efforts to the south and east. For an Ostrogothic future to be ensured, our grip on Italy must be maintained at all costs. If we also happen to bring Africa and the Balkans under our control then more’s the better!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664946	Your time has come. The Western Roman Empire is weak, beset by political turmoil and with its military resources stretched thin. Under threat from all sides, Rome may trust in your current treaties and abandon the Rhineland in favour of reinforcing other fronts. When that day comes, you must be ready to strike, by land or by sea. Until then, content yourself with conquest and plunder of your neighbours. Beware the northern tribes as the cold drives them to range further south, and also the Huns; they have wrought havoc across the east and surge ever westward. Ultimately, you must establish a great Frankish Kingdom to dominate any who dare oppose you! 	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665946	It was Clovis who united the Franks and fired the hunger for conquest in the breast of our people. The Romans, Visigoths, Alamans and Burgundians have all tried to halt our advance, and all have been stripped of both lands and dignity. The Burgundian leader, Gundobad, slew the family of Queen Clotilde and now her step-son, our  King Theuderic, marches to punish their treachery. We must eradicate these people and secure our advance south. Here, the Visigoths lick their wounds and eye the territory we so recently wrested from their grasp. Their remaining lands are fertile, yet poorly guarded, and would make a fine acquisition! However, we must keep some strength in reserve. The Romans dream of reconquering Italy - defeat them and we may yet conquer all Rome’s former lands in the west. We alone defend the true faith, and God will reward his people with the creation of a new Christian empire in Europe!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665745	Your name – ‘all men’ - reflects the unusual unity between the disparate tribes that make up your people. With the Romans lurking across the Rhine you were forced to look to each other for strength and your repeated forays into enemy territory have demonstrated the efficacy of your approach. Though an uneasy peace is now in effect, the vulnerability of the city of Argentoratum – the site of your most humbling defeat – taunts your warriors. Before you take it, however, you must consolidate your position. The malicious Vandals lurk to the east, waiting for you to overextend. Protect against them by calling together your Germanic cousins - the Marcomanni, Langobards and Franks will flock to your banners when they hear your mighty war cry!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665848	Certain factions may recruit units with the raider trait.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665353	Maintaining a unit's courage and discipline in the heat of battle is dependent on their morale - a measure of pride and belief in their abilities. This is boosted by training, experience and the presence of an inspirational commander. Morale is weakest when their general is dead and a unit is heavily outnumbered or outmatched by an enemy. You can see their morale state just above their unit banner.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665952	Since deposing Hilderic and taking the Vandal throne for himself, Gelimer has set about reinventing the kingdom in the image of his great grandfather, Gaiseric. However, deposing a pro-Roman king has drawn the attention of the Emperor. He has sent an expeditionary force, commanded by a general called Belisarius, to take back northern Africa in the name of the Roman Empire. This must be dealt with swiftly; we must not allow the Romans to get a foothold. Once Africa is secure we must turn our attention to the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, as these places are also Vandalic possessions by right of conquest. Our fleet must be rebuilt if we are to succeed in this. It may only be a matter of time before the seas are under control once again, but the real prize is Rome. Once Africa and the western Mediterranean are secure we must turn our attention to the conquest of Italy, for you cannot rule the world if you do not rule in Rome!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664950	Your people have come far, hailing from beyond the Sarmatian Sea, but their journey is not yet over. Climate change and the arrival of the Huns have displaced many tribes, including your own, and so your migration southwest-ward continues. Your troubled history with the Eastern Roman Empire gives you cause to plunder as you go, but you need not settle so soon.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665959	Our people have come a long way - where once we sought refuge over the Rhine as a band of shivering refugees, now we are lords of the large and fertile Iberian Peninsula. But we must not grow complacent. The reign of a child king has weakened our power, causing the infighting which besets us still. To make matters worse, at our lowest ebb the rapacious Frankish kings stripped us of our former possessions in Gaul. We will redress this wrong and put an end to Frankish avarice, but first we should focus on consolidating our gains. The Suebi to the west wage a bitter and persistent war and will prevent us from deploying our troops until they are defeated and swept away. Once we have reclaimed our stolen land, we can think once again about forging an empire. Africa lays a stone’s throw away, across the water - we should have little trouble seizing it from the Vandals, who have surely lost their taste for conquest.However, beware the Romans.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665581	Select one force and right-click on another to move units between it. Note that since they can have one commander only, moving everything into one force will leave one general or admiral without any troops or ships.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665780	Take time to manage your armies after each battle. Depleted armies on the campaign map can consolidate their strength by merging damaged units. Simply select two identical units by holding CTRL and clicking on their unit cards, hover over one of the units, and click merge in the army options popup. This also reduces the upkeep cost of the army as you’re paying for one unit rather than two, thereby freeing up funds for fresh recruits.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665384	Make the best use of your missile units by attacking the rear or right-hand side of their targets, away from their shields and armour.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664288	It is clear that the Huns and the Ostrogoths are not working together as we suspected. The Huns are to be feared, and we cannot afford to be unprepared if they come in force. We must finish our war with the Ostrogoths, for they are weak after their defeat. Let us attack!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664688	Our growing power allows us to field more armies, Chieftain. Let us take advantage and recruit another General.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665588	If playing as a barbarian faction, and the enemy is getting too close to your final settlement, it is now possible to abandon it and become a horde.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665390	Sieges can take years to come to a conclusion, gradually wearing a settlement and its defenders down. The longer a settlement is under siege, the worse its physical condition becomes, making it easier for the attacker to penetrate the defences. This also means that the state of a besieged settlement will be reflected in the condition of its buildings, and the morale of its defenders, during any battle that may take place there.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665990	However, there are those who would yet try to undo you; in the northwest, the Christian Asturians, who resist you from beyond the Cantabrian Mountains. Destroy them, and consolidate your power over the Spanish Peninsula.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665795	When specific requirements have been met through unlocking key technologies and building the correct structures, you can upgrade your troops to improve their equipment and abilities.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660199	A non-aggression pact is an agreement between two factions not to attack each other. It can be broken at any time by either party, but there is a diplomatic relations penalty for doing so. Breaking a pact within ten turns is seen as treachery and will therefore affect the ability to broker future agreements.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665299	All factions have the option to abandon their settlements, desolating the surrounding region as they go. If the enemy is getting too close, and it looks like you will lose a region, it is now possible to abandon its settlement – enacting a scorched earth policy to deny the invaders their prize. When you leave, a small amount will be added to your treasury. Any faction that resettles or colonises will find a ruined settlement in a region with reduced fertility - a situation which only recovers over time.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665599	Your family’s political power is determined by two factors: control and dominion. Your control over the political situation and the elites is determined by your ability to resolve political matters and react to other faction events, and can be hard to attain. Your dominion over the faction and the people, however, depends on your family members’ influence versus that of your faction’s other nobles.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665999	To the southwest, Wessex lingers - weak but undefeated - and to the west the pernicious Welsh remain a thorn. 	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665198	The rebels have struck at Thessalonica, bringing down the fortifications and burning the city. So humiliating has been our inaction that the council has moved to have you replaced, Chieftain! I would make yourself scarce before the army finds you!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665498	The enemy hold the high ground, Chieftain! We must attack with caution.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665598	Damage done on the campaign map will be visible on the battlefield; it takes time and money to repair it, something the besieged can ill afford. A direct assault on a province capital without artillery or siege equipment is only possible after allowing a siege to escalate over time, causing breaches in the settlement walls through which your troops can attempt entry.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665898	The avaricious Huns have driven your people into the heart of the hostile Roman Empire. Although your flight across the Rhine has earned you a brief respite from the horde, you cannot stay here for long without invoking Rome’s ire. Meanwhile, your kin and allies, the Alamans, try valiantly to protect your ancestral lands from the marauding Vandals. Though you may aid them in their struggle, your true destiny lies to the west, and the untold riches of Hispania. The road ahead is tough; you must pass through the Empire and the Romans will oppose you at every step. However, there will be many opportunities for plunder and glory along the way - and the chance to carve out a future from their fertile lands!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_-878278296	Attrition is the loss of men due to desertion, disease, etc. An army will generally suffer [[url:/manual/page/single-player/0026_enc_page_campaign_play_military_replenish]]attrition[[/url]] when in desert or extremely cold conditions unless it is native to that part of the world. Ship crews and armies transported by sea may also suffer attrition when in deep waters.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_-97375295	The best admirals adapt their tactics to the given situation. Take advantage of fog or heavy smoke to hide small or heavily damaged ships. This makes the enemy's job more difficult, a factor which can often prove crucial during the course of a battle.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_606296587	Your port has been blockaded by an enemy fleet.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_-595875202	Winning a battle isn't just about greater numbers, the balance of units and the general's ability are important factors also.
