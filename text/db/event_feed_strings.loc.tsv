event_feed_strings_text_att_event_feed_string_scripted_event_independence_secondary_detail	History is full of the stories of great men wasted under the command of weak rulers. Justinian, alas, has proved himself just such a lord – his jealousy hampering Belisarius at every turn, eventually becoming a threat to his life and position. The Emperor may have been born to rule, but Belisarius was also born with a destiny. He will restore the faded glory of the Western Empire, and any impediments will be left behind. Justinian is furious at this betrayal, and overcoming him will be as much of a challenge as the conquest of Italy. Nonetheless, Belisarius embraces the task. Unleashed, he will bring the world to its knees!	true
