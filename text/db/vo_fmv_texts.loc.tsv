vo_fmv_texts_text_cha_intro	There have been many kings before you.  |Many names, many titles.  |Men who rose from nothing.  |Men who risked all that they love.  |To lead by honour, and virtue and inspire the common man.  |Do you think you’re different?  |Somehow chosen?  |Who gave you the right to rule?  |It wasn’t the people.  |It wasn’t God.  |It was you.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_belisarius_intro	I couldn’t think of a finer man for the task…  |Retake the former Western Roman Empire from the barbarians? |Deliver it to our beloved Emperor on a plate?|These games should be in your honour! |When I heard Justinian had you in mind, I can’t say I was surprised… |After all, you were his uncle’s favourite bodyguard.  |Not to mention your accomplishments at the battle of Dara…|And the way you suppressed the riots in Nika…  |You are the last of the great commanders,  |and your loyalty is clearly above question. |However… the ruins of Rome are a wild and unpredictable place,  |a lot can happen out of reach of these fragrant walls.  |A man might look about him, and think, perhaps, that it is all rightfully his. |Good luck...  |Belisarius	true

vo_fmv_texts_text_INTRO	Ah Rome, the eternal city.  |I have seen the end of days and years from now men will say,  |“Here began the fall of Rome.”  |The power of the Senate was taken from the many and given to the few.  |Those who wore the golden wreath grew sick with every kind of wickedness.  |They were filled with greed, deceit and malice. They condemned and enslaved.  |They betrayed their friends and murdered those they loved.  |They did all this and called it just.  |“And I saw in his hand a book, sealed with seven seals, the first of which was broken...  |And behold a white horse; and he that sat on him had a bow; and he went forth to conquer…”  |The air was filled with smoke and blood.  	true

vo_fmv_texts_text_white_huns_win	From the frozen slopes of the Hindu Kush, you looked down upon the great empires of the west.  |Others trembled at the sight of the vast fortifications and the shining swarms of armoured warriors, but you – you hungered!  |With one purpose, you swept down onto the fertile plains.  |Disembowelling great nations and feasting on their glittering entrails,| you daubed your name on the annals of history with their blood!  |Truly, the White Huns have painted the world red! 	true

vo_fmv_texts_text_att_seal_2a	The air was filled with smoke and blood.  |Rome was weak.  |The tribes grew in strength and number.  |Their roots went deep and they felt the earth’s blood pounding through the land.  |But their borders were threatened, for a great storm raged in the east.  |One by one the tribes scattered, as seeds in the wind.  |“And behold a red horse: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth...”  |The blood of their kin would be avenged.  |Great hunters, they tempered their blades in Roman blood and saw their once mighty walls reduced to dust.  |They made ready for war.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_att_seal_2c	The air was filled with smoke and blood.  |What the Romans stole the east reclaimed with vengeance,  |as Emperor Valerian discovered when  his love of wealth was rewarded with molten gold.  |Rome was the city of lies.

vo_fmv_texts_text_att_seal_2b	The air was filled with smoke and blood.  |The Huns gloried in the stench of death.  |They took what they needed and left their enemies to rot.  |The Huns were free. They rode and fought and lived.  |Fear built Roman walls.  |They were right to be afraid.  |“And behold a red horse: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth…”  |Those with gold offered it by the wagon.  |The Huns took it and allowed them to live, in fear.   |At least until they returned.  |The riders of the four winds prayed to Him of the Eternal Sky.  |They made ready for war.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_att_seal_2e	The air was filled with smoke and blood.  |The Roman Empire was divided.  |From the Pillars of Hercules to the far reaches of the Adriatic the Western Empire stretched; sacred earth where men of greatness conquered.  |But those who followed neglected Rome, fighting over the scraps of past glory.  |They would either cast aside their petty differences or succumb to barbarous darkness.  |“And behold a red horse: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth…”  |Romans of the Western Empire, those noble sons of the eternal city.
