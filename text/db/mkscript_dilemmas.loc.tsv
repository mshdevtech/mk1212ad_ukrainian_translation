dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_byzantium_greek_fire_explosion	Grave news!

dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_crusades_join_fifth_crusade	The time has come to prove yourself a true servant of the Lord. His Holiness, Pope Honorius III now calls upon every able-bodied Christian in Europe to answer his call to arms. The main target of the crusade is Cairo, and if taken, the crusade may proceed into the Holy Land and liberate it from infidel hands once and for all. Joining the crusade will be a substantial commitment, though not without rewards, but abstaining will surely trouble the Pope.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_crusades_owned_target	With the capture of the Crusade's target from the infidels, the Crusaders have clearly triumphed.

dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_hre_imperial_immediacy	A subject of the faction1 has petitioned you to grant it imperial immediacy, thereby bypassing their lord and placing them directly under your authority.

dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_hre_noble_conflict	Nobles from the families of the faction1 and the faction2 have been embroiled in a dispute for some time, and now both sides seek to present their case to you.

dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_islam_hajj		
dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_rome_attacked_christian	Rome, the center of the world, has fallen to your armies. The Pope is now at your mercy.

dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_story_aragon_albigensian_intervention	Having defeated the Moors in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, the Pope now requests your aid to the North in the crusade against the Cathars. However, France's influence over Languedoc grows and it is likely that the King of France intends to annex the entirety of the region to his Kingdom.

dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_story_england_magna_carta	Discontented and outright rebellious nobles have now mustered the audacity to demand of you certain restrictions on your power.

dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_story_england_magna_carta_renew	With the passing of rulership to the new king, the time has come to re-iterate the crown's commitment to the Magna Carta. Failure to do so will certainly stir up discontented nobles.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_story_england_war_with_france	Whispers have alerted the King that nobles are conspiring, thinking him weak.

dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_story_france_english_rebels_alliance	With the English barons in full revolt against their liege, the question of an alliance with them remains.

dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_story_france_pursue_england	English nobles, exasperated by the incompetence of their king and his failure in France, have risen up in England against his rule!

dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_story_hungary_cumans_fleeing_mongols	With their homeland ravaged by the new invaders from the far east, the nomadic people of the Cumans have come to the king of Hungary with a request for asylum, and in return their king promises to covert his people to Christianity.

dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_story_hungary_golden_bull_1222	Hungary's nobles have long desired increased checks on royal power and increased power in their own right.

Chiefly, these include tax exemptions and the right for nobles to refuse calls to war outside the realm unless paid, and restrictions on the rights of foreigners within the realm. Decreeing this Golden Bull will severely cripple the authority of the King, but refusing to pass the Golden Bull may severely destabilize the realm.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_mk_dilemma_story_sicily_join_crusade	The time has come to prove yourself a true servant of the Lord. After backing your claim to the emperorship, His Holiness the Pope now expects in return that you will embark on a crusade to retake the Holy Land. The main target of the crusade is Cairo, and if taken, the crusade may proceed into the Holy Land and liberate it from infidel hands once and for all.

His Holiness, Innocent III, now backs you as claimaint to the title of Emperor of the Romans.
