prologue_chapters_description_1	It is AD370, and Roman control over the Mediterranean has held for hundreds of years. Yet the glory days of the Pax Romana are long gone. Rome's power has atrophied considerably since the reign of Augustus, its decadent ruling classes and archaic command structures struggling to keep pace with the demands of a changing world. During the crisis of the 3rd century AD the Empire nearly collapsed, weighed down by a perfect storm of foreign invasion, economic depression and civil war.\\n\\nYet the Empire survives in a new form since Diocletian's reforms, with separate centres of administration in the East and West. Nevertheless, the Roman aura of invincibility is crumbling. Peoples from across the Rhine and Danube rivers are becoming accustomed to raiding Roman territory, appropriating Roman valuables and scoring occasional victories against Roman armies.\\n\\nAnd in the East, unseen by all, a long shadow is looming. The Huns are coming.\\n\\nCaught in the middle are a number of barbarian tribes. One of these, the Visigoths, is involved in a civil war of its own. This is their story.	true
prologue_chapters_description_2	It is the morning after the Battle of Olbia. Smoke hangs over the city and many bodies still lie where they fell.\\n\\nThe Visigoths may have defeated their rival Goths, as well as their Hunnic allies, but they are not yet out of danger. Their army is thinned by battle and their capital lies in ruins. Meanwhile, two more enemy forces are already on their way - the Ostrogoths attack from the west, and the Huns from the east.\\n\\nThe Visigoths will have to rush to rebuild their defences before the enemy army arrives again. Olbia must be rebuilt and fortified, and the army reinforced. Time is not on the side of the Visigoths, however, and they will have to work quickly to have any chance of survival in the coming war.	true
